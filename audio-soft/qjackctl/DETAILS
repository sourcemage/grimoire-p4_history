cat << EOF
Qjackctl is a simple Qt application to control the JACK sound server 
daemon, specific for the Linux Audio Desktop infrastructure.

Written in C++ around the Qt3 toolkit for X11, most exclusively using Qt 
Designer.

Provides a simple GUI dialog for setting several JACK daemon parameters, 
which are properly saved between sessions, and a way control of the 
status of the audio server daemon. With time, this primordial interface 
has become richer by including a enhanced patchbay and connection 
control features.
