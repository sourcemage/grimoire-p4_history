The GLUT API is intended for small to medium sized OpenGL Programs. It's
well suited for basic UI:s, and crossplatform applications. The GLUT
library supports the following functionality: multiple windows for
OpenGL rendering, callback driven event processing, an 'idle' routine
and timers, utility routines to generate various solid and wire frame
