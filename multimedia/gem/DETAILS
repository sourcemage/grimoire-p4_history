SHORT="GEM is the Graphics Environment for Multimedia - an external lib for PureData"
cat << EOF
GEM is the Graphics Environment for Multimedia. It was written by Mark Danks to generate real-time computer graphics, especially for
audio-visual compositions. Because GEM is a visual programming environment, users do not need any experience in traditional computer languages. 
GEM is a collection of externals which allow the user to create OpenGL graphics within Pd, a program for real-time audio processing by Miller
Puckette (of Max fame). 
GEM currently has many different shapes and objects, including polygonal graphics, lighting, texture mapping, image processing, and camera
motion. All of this is possible in real-time without any previous programming experience. Because GEM is an add-on library for Pd, users can
combine audio and graphics, controlling one medium from another. 
Supported in part by a grant from the Intel Research Council for the The Global Visual Music project of Vibeke Sorensen, Miller Puckette and
Rand Steiger.
