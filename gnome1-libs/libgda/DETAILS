GNU Data Access (GDA) is an attempt to provide uniform access to 
different kinds of data sources (databases, information servers, mail
spools, etc).  It is a complete architecture that provides all you need
to access your data.  It is defined by a set of CORBA interfaces as
generic as possible (but very powerful at the same time) so that any
kind of data source can be accessed through them.
libgda is an interface to the GDA architecture, providing a nice
wrapper around the CORBA interfaces, for both the client and the server
parts. It also provides a bunch of tools to help you both in the
development and management of your data sources, all done through
the GDA model's set of CORBA interfaces.
libgda was part of the GNOME-DB project
(http://www.gnome.org/projects/gnome-db),
but has been separated from it to allow non-GNOME applications to be
developed based on it.
libgda is released under the terms of the GPL and LGPL licenses. The
specific parts of the architecture are licensed under one of them:
executables, such as the command-line tools and the database providers
are licensed under the GPL license, which means that any work derived
from it must also adhere to the terms of the GPL license. Libraries
(libgda-common, libgda-client, libgda-server , libgda-report) are, on
the other hand, licensed under the LGPL license, which allows for
commercial applications to be developed based on libgda.
