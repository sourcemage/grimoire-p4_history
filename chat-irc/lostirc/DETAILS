cat << EOF
LostIRC is a simple, yet very useful IRC client.  It has features such 
as tab-autocompletion, multiple server support, automatic joining of 
servers/channel logging and DCC sending which should cover the nees of 
most people.  Another goal that the application has in mind is 100% 
keyboard controlability.  It was written using the gtkmm GUI library.
