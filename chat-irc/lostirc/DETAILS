cat << EOF
LostIRC is a simple, yet very useful IRC client. It has features such as
tab-autocompletion, multiple server support, automatic joining of servers/channels,
logging and DCC sending which should cover the needs of most people. Another goal
that the application has in mind, is 100% keyboard controlability. It was written
using the gtkmm GUI library.
