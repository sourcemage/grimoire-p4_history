Shortly put, icecap is to instant messaging what IMAP is to mail. You 
can safely exit your irssi2 client, and irssi2 server just keeps on 
going. When you connect back with your client, you can see all the 
discussion that happened while you were away (and even older discussion, 
too, if you want).
You can also use multiple clients even at the same time, so you could 
for example keep one client always open at home and still be able to 
check what's going on with your mobile phone.
Icecap clients are encouraged to keep their configuration in server 
side, so nothing should prevent you from temporarily using another 
icecap client from your friend's home with no other configuration needed 
than icecap server's address, your username and password.
