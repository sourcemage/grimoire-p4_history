irssi - a textmode irc client
Irssi is a modular IRC client that currently has 
only text mode user interface, but 80-90% of the 
code isn't text mode specific, so other UIs could
be created pretty easily. Also, Irssi isn't really
even IRC specific anymore, there's already a working
SILC module available. Support for other protocols
like ICQ could be created some day too.
