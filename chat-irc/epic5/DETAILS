cat << EOF
EPIC5 is a new direction in ircII development.  No longer is EPIC
100% backwards compatable with ircII, but instead we have chosen to
find those things where compatability is undesirable, and fix them.
No gratuitous incompatabilities have been added, but lots of  new
code has been added to make EPIC the best ircII client we could make.
