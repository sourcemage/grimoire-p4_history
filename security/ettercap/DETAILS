Ettercap is a network sniffer/interceptor/logger for ethernet LANs. 
It supports active and passive dissection of many protocols (even
ciphered ones, like SSH and HTTPS).  Data injection in an established
connection and filtering on the fly is also possible, keeping the
connection synchronized. Many sniffing modes were implemented to give
you a powerful and complete sniffing suite.  Plugins are supported. It
has the ability to check whether you are in a switched LAN or 
not, and to use OS fingerprints (active or passive) to let you know the
geometry of the LAN.
