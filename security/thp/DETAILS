cat << EOF
Tiny Honeypot (thp) is a simple honey pot program based on iptables 
redirects and an xinetd listener. It listens on every TCP port not 
currently in use, logging all activity and providing some feedback 
to the attacker. The responders are entirely written in Perl, and 
provide just enough interaction to fool most automated attack tools, 
as well as quite a few humans, at least for a little while. With 
appropriate limits (default), thp can reside on production hosts 
with negligible impact on performance.
