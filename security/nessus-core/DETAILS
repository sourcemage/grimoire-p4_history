nessus-core - part of the Nessus project - part 3 of 4

The "Nessus" Project aims to provide to the internet community a free,
powerful, up-to-date and easy to use remote security scanner.

A security scanner is a software which will audit remotely a given
network and determine whether bad guys (aka 'crackers') may break into
it, or misuse it in some way.

Unlike many other security scanners, Nessus does not take anything for
granted. That is, it will not consider that a given service is running on
a fixed port - that is, if you run your web server on port 1234, Nessus
will detect it and test its security. It will not make its security tests
regarding the version number of the remote services, but will really
attempt to exploit the vulnerability.

Nessus is very fast, reliable and has a modular architecture that allows
you to fit it to your needs.
