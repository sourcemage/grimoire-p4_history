Remote Access Session is a security tool to analyze the integrity of systems. The program tries
to gain access to a system using the most advanced techniques of remote intrusion. It can either
work in normal mode (which is fast) or hard mode (which is more intensive). There is a big 
difference between Remote Access Session and other remote security audit tools. If Remote Access
Session finds a remote vulnerability that gives user account or root, it will try to exploit it
and it will return a shell. This allows a network administrator to discard false positives 
regarding remote vulnerabilities. It also includes all of the information from service banners 
in its output. It performs vendor and version detection on Web servers and other common servers, 
and also attempts remote OS identification.
