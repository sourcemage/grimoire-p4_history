cat << EOF
Existing key servers for Pretty Good Privacy(TM) (PGP) use the PGP 
program for key management. PGP was not designed to handle large 
keyrings, and as a result, performance of the existing key server 
suffers badly. In this paper, I describe the specification and design 
of a new key server which does not depend on PGP for any of its 
functions. This new key server is a ``drop-in'' replacement for the old 
key server, providing almost all of the same functionality via both the 
e-mail and HTTP interfaces, with much improved performance. Early 
testing of this server under simulated production conditions 
demonstrates a performance increase of about two orders of magnitude 
compared to the old server. This increase is directly attributable to 
storing the key database in hash tables and balanced trees instead of a 
PGP format keyring.
