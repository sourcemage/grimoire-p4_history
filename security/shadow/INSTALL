# Login.defs variables that control functionality duplicated by PAM, where removed here. However,
# they appear not to be relevant anyway as follows from login.defs manpage:
#   Much of the functionality that used to be provided by the shadow password suite  is  now  handled  by
#   PAM.  Thus, /etc/login.defs is no longer used by programs such as: login(1), passwd(1), su(1). Please
#   refer to the corresponding PAM configuration files instead.
# Additionally, these variables have their default values, so removing them from login.defs did not
# disable related functionality per se.
