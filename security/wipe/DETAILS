cat << EOF
Recovery of supposedly erased data from magnetic media is
easier than what many people would like to believe. A
technique called Magnetic Force Microscopy (MFM) allows any
moderately funded opponent recover the last two or three
layers of data written to disk. Wipe repeadetly overwrites
special patterns to the files to be destroyed, using the
fsync() call and/or the O_SYNC bit to force disk access.
