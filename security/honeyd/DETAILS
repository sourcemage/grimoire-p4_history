cat << EOF
Honeyd is a small daemon that creates virtual hosts on a network. The hosts can be 
configured to run arbitrary services, and their TCP personality can be adapted so 
that they appear to be running certain versions of operating systems. Honeyd 
enables a single host to claim multiple addresses on a LAN for network simulation. 
It is possible to ping the virtual machines, or to traceroute them. Any type of 
service on the virtual machine can be simulated according to a simple configuration 
file. Instead of simulating a service, it is also possible to proxy it to another 
machine.
