EtherApe is a graphical network monitor for Unix modeled after etherman. 
Featuring link layer, ip and TCP modes, it displays network activity 
graphically. Hosts and links change in size with traffic. Color coded 
protocols display. It supports Ethernet, FDDI, Token Ring, ISDN, PPP and 
SLIP devices. It can filter traffic to be shown, and can read traffic 
from a file as well as live from the network.
