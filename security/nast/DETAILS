Nast is a packet sniffer and a LAN analyzer based on Libnet and Libpcap. 
It can sniff in normal mode or in promiscuous mode the packets on a network
interface. It dumps the headers of packets and the payload in ascii or 
ascii-hex format. You can apply a filter (e.g. "src ip", "port 22"...).The 
data sniffed can be saved in a separated file.
As analyzer tool, it can check for other NIC set in promisc mode, build the 
list of all hosts of the LAN, find a gateway, perform a port scanning of a 
single/multiple host/s and catch daemon banner for the hosts of the LAN, 
follow  the TCP data stream, reset a connection, and find out the link type 
(HUB or SWITCH).
It also provides a ncurses menu.
