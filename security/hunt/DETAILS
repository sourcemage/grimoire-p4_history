Hunt is a program for intruding into a connection, watching it and resetting 
it. It has several features, which I didn't find in any product like
Juggernaut or T-sight that inspired me in my development.
Note that hunt is operating on Ethernet and is best used for connections
which can be watched through it. However, it is possible to do something
even for hosts on another segments or hosts that are on switched ports. 
The hunt doesn't distinguish between local network connections and connections
going to/from Internet. It can handle all connections it sees.

Connection hijacking is aimed primarily at the telnet or rlogin traffic but 
it can be used for another traffic too.
