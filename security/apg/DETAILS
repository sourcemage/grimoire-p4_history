Advantages
* Built-in ANSI X9.17 RNG (Random Number Generator)(CAST/SHA1)
* Built-in password quality checking system (it has support for Bloom filter for faster access)
* Two Password Generation Algorithms:
  1. Pronounceable Password Generation Algorithm (according to NIST FIPS 181)
  2. Random Character Password Generation Algorithm with 27 (35 for APG >= 2.0.0b0) configurable modes of operation
* Configurable password length parameters
* Configurable amount of generated passwords
* Ability to initialize RNG with user string
* Support for /dev/random
* Ability to crypt() generated passwords and print them as additional output.
* Special parameters to use APG in script
* Ability to log password generation requests for network version
* Ability to control APG service access using tcpd
* Ability to use password generation service from any type of box (Mac, WinXX, etc.) that connected to network
* Ability to enforce remote users to use only allowed type of password generation
