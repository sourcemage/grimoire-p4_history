           SHORT="NetPipe is a socket redirector."
cat << EOF
NetPipe is a redirector at it's core. It takes a socket in on one port, and 
reconnects that data out on the second port. It supports Multicast socket, 
UDP, TCP, and ICMP.* It is a fully functioning socket redirector, the aim of
which is to open ports on a firewall without using IPTABLES. 
The PRIMARY function of NetPipe is to allow socket redirection through a 
firewall without using the firewall's core packet restricting information. 
This is useful if you're workplace has a restrictive firewall, so you can't 
connect out on port 25 to send email. You simply startup netpipe, and from 
work you can connect to your mailserver and send email. How about a 
redirector for 110 also? no problem.     
Netpipe can redirect any TCP/UDP socket.
