ScanSSH scans a list of addresses and networks for open proxies, SSH protocol servers, Web, and SMTP servers. Where possible, it displays the version number of the running services. It supports random selection of IP addresses from large network ranges and is useful for gathering statistics on the deployment of SSH protocol servers in a company or the Internet as a whole.
