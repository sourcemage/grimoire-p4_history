	* PREPARE: added post_patch variable to patchfiles
	  post_patch contains a space separated list of patches that
	  are required to be patched after the current patch is complete.
	  Also remove optional build dir, for most patched kernels it 
	  doesn't work and don't know why you would do this in the first 
	  place so I removed the code from BUILD PRE_BUILD INSTALL and
	  commented out the menu in PREPARE so if someone wanted they 
	  could make this work.
