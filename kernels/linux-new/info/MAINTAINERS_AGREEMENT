POINT OF DOCUMENT:
This file is to put a "Maintainer's Agreement" to limit the size of the info
directory. The way the spell is written right now can support (theoretically)
an infinate number of kernel versions, infinate number of patches, and infinate
number of patch versions for each patch. So in order to keep size down to a
minimum this document was created.

CONTENTS OF DOCUMENT:
This document contains limitation numbers on the number of versions for each
patch and kernel.  These kernels and patches we will support anything older we
will not support.
