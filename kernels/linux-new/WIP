Okay this is the first release of the new linux spell.
Check it out if you want to add files that would be helpful.

Notes on making the files for patches:
FILE NAME: should reflect the uncompressed filename
patchversion: should also reflect the uncompressed filename
source: should reflect the full name of the file being downloaded
md5sum: is the md5sum of the uncompressed patch
source_url: is the web/ftp site you download the source from
appliedkernels: this is a space separated list of kernels the patch can apply to
pval: is the -p# number passed to patch

finally put them in an appropriate folder under the ${SCRIPT_DIRECTORY}/info/patches/ dir

Notes on making the files for kernels:
FILE NAME: should reflect the kernel version being downloaded
version: should also reflect the kernel version being downloaded
source: should reflect the file being downloaded
source_url: should reflect the web/ftp site you download the source from
md5sum: should be the md5sum of the uncompressed source
patches: a space separated list of patches that can be applied to that kernel

IF YOU WANT TO SEE WHAT WORKS:
Try the LATEST_2_6 with any of the patches
