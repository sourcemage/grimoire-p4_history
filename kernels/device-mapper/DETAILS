cat << EOF
The Device-mapper is a new component of the linux kernel that supports logical 
volume management. It is required by LVM2 and EVMS. The original LVM (included 
in stock 2.4 kernels) does not use it.

If you intend to use Device-mapper, as well as adding it to your kernel, you 
should install the userspace configuration tool (dmsetup) and library 
(libdevmapper), you should install this spell.
