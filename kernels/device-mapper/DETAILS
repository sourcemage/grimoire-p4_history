(Remember to patch your 2.4 kernel with the dm patch in the linux spell.)

The goal of this driver is to support volume management.  
The driver enables the definition of new block devices composed of
ranges of sectors of existing devices.  This can be used to define
disk partitions - or logical volumes.  This light-weight kernel
component can support user-space tools for logical volume management.

The driver maps ranges of sectors for the new logical device onto
'mapping targets' according to a mapping table.  Currently the mapping 
table must be supplied to the driver through an ioctl interface.
Earlier versions of the driver also had a custom file system interface 
(dmfs), but we stopped work on this because of pressure of time.
