Splashutils is a collection of programs and scripts that can be used to provide
a graphical, visually attractive environment during the system boot. Most of
the programs from this package can be used even on systems where kernels are
not patched with fbsplash. The main splash utility (splash_util) is responsible
for the so-called silent mode and can be run as a daemon. The splash_helper
program is called directly by the kernel and is used to provide background
images for consoles.
