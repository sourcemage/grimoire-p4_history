"splash" is used to attach a picture to an initrd or change the picture while the system is running. 
splash can also be used to trigger command execution when a specified runlevel script is reached. 
This can for example be used to show animations during bootup.
You will also need the graphics and config files.
There are many themes to choose from at 
http://www.bootsplash.org/themes.html
QUICK HOWTO...
/sbin/splash -s -f /etc/bootsplash/themes/*YOURTHEME*/config/bootsplash-1024x768.cfg >>/boot/splash.initrd
then add "initrd = /boot/splash.initrd" and "vga = 791" to the lilo.conf entry for the bootsplash 
enabled kernel.
