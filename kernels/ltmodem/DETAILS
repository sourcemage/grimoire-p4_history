LTModem is a driver for software modems based on the Lucent Apollo (ISA) and Mars (PCI) chipsets. Lucent AMR modems are not supported by this driver. The core communications code of these kits is the property of Agere Systems, Inc. (formerly known as Microelectronics Group of Lucent Technologies). The driver was developed and is maintained by Soumyendu Sarkar at Agere Systems, the open source parts were modified by Mark Spieth, Marvin Stodolsky and Christoph Hebeisen to implement some additional features.
