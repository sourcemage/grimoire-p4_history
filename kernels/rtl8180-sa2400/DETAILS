cat << EOF
This is an attempt to write somethig that can make my rtl8180-based wlan 
card work under Linux (using only opensource stuff). It's in early 
development stage so don't expect too much from it.
(also use it at your own risk!)
This should be considered just a fragment of code.. using it on 
your(any) system is at your own risk!
