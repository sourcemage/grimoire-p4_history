cat << EOF
Pike is a dynamic programming language with a syntax similar 
to Java and C. It is simple to learn, does not require long 
compilation passes and has powerful built-in data types allowing 
simple and fast data manipulation.

The many modules that come with the distribution offer extended 
networking and database support, a GTK interface, Unicode support
and matrix calculations, among other things.
