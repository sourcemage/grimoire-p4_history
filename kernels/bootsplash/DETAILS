splash is used to attach a picture to an initrd or change the picture while
the system is running.  splash can also be used to trigger command execution
when a specified runlevel script is reached.  This can for example be used to
show animations during bootup.  You will also need the graphics and config
files.  There are several SuSE-based themes to choose from at
http://www.bootsplash.org/themes.html or you can cast the boot-theme spell to
get one based on a Source Mage logo.

QUICK HOWTO...
/sbin/splash -s -n /etc/bootsplash/themes/*YOURTHEME*/config/bootsplash-1024x768.cfg \
>> /boot/splash.initrd
then add "initrd = /boot/splash.initrd" and "vga = 791" to the lilo.conf or
menu.lst entry for the bootsplash enabled kernel.

vga=xxx sets the framebuffer console to a specific resolution.  Here is a
table you can use so it can help you decide what resolution you want to use.
Currently bootsplash only supprts a 16 bit color depth, so select vlues from
that row only.
  depth    colors  640x480      800x600      1024x768     1280x1024
   8 bits     256  769 (0x301)  771 (0x303)  773 (0x305)  775 (0x307)
