 Starting with kernel 2.4, hotplugging is a standard
feature of GNU/Linux. Its goal is letting you plug in new devices and
use them immediately. That means that users won't need to learn so much
system administration; systems will at least partially autoconfigure
themselves. Initially, hotplug included support for USB and PCI
(Cardbus) devices, and could automatically configure some common network
interfaces. Updated versions include IEEE 1394 (Firewire/i.Link) support
and can download firmware to USB devices that need it. On mainframes,
S/390 channel devices uses hotplugging to report device attach and other
state change events. For laptops, newer kernels also include support for
reporting docking station activity. 

With this script, there is no need to mention any usb devices in
/etc/modules
