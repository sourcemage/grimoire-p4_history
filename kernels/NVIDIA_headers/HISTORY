		Reakised old cache is removed as part of prune so changed prepare to show current 
		version

2003-06-20  hgg <hgreig@bigpond.net.au>

		Changed PREPARE to be fully automatic, so it catches cache no matter the previous 
		version.

		Removing ARCHIVE=off from DETAILS (its just confusing having it there)

2003-06-19  hgg <hgreig@bigpond.net.au>

		Found out how to make ARCHIVE=off work with a POST_BUILD file
		this fixes issue of resurrection killing the backup.
		
		Some installs will have a cache so added a PREPARE file to remove bad cache before any problems occur
