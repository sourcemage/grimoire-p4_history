This project provides a device driver allowing 3rd-party (userland) 
applications to execute file access control. 
It was originally developed by H+BEDV Datentechnik GmbH to allow 
on-access virus scanning. Other uses include 
a file-access monitor/logger or external security implementations. 
It operates by intercepting file access calls and passing the file 
information to a 3rd-party application. 
The 3rd-party application then has the opportunity to tell the device 
driver to allow or deny the file access. 
The 3rd-party application also receives information about 
the access event, such as accessed file, type of access, 
process id, andH user id.
