		The spell now respects INSTALL_ROOT and HOST.

2003-05-16  Seth Woolley <seth@tautology.org>

		Changed checkmd5() routine to match our interpreted URL setup
		(BTW, that's totally borked, but that's sorcery's fault)
		Added hashDoS patch for security fix. part of bug #3362.

2003-02-27  Eric Sandall <eric@sandall.us>

		Added support for Sparc systems

		Changed case statement in UPDATE_BOOTLOADER to use `uname -m`
		as $BUILD is not defined yet

2003-01-08  Seth Woolley <seth@tautology.org>

		Added MD5 and GPG support to everything.  Now
		nothing should be downloaded from this spell
		without some sort of verification.

		GPG was chosen because the spell allows one to arbitrarily 
		pick CUSTOM kernels, and kernel.org already has
		a .sign file for every regular file.

		PRE_BUILD, DETAILS, HISTORY modified

		MD5PATCH, GPGPATCH added

		CONFIGURE changed to PREPARE and modified

		kernel.gpg (for kernel.org) added.
		grsecurity.gpg (for grsecurity.org) added.

		All patches/* have all MD5s filled in and line added
		to call MD5PATCH script, unless gpg would work on them
		as those have a GPGPATCH call instead and their
		PUBRINGFILE variable set.

		ck split into ck and ck_extras.

		Various patches were updated.

		Raven framebuffer made optional and put in patches/

		If gpg is not found, it will explain steps to get around
		a lack of gnupg, even if no kernel headers exist.

		Made HISTORY file smgl-compliant.

		Wolfgang debugged and helped immensely.

		the list so they are forced to use TRIGGERS

2002-09-21  Wolfgang Scheicher <worf@sbox.tu-graz.ac.at>

		Finally replacing old kernel spells by this one

2002-08-20  Wolfgang Scheicher <worf@sbox.tu-graz.ac.at>
