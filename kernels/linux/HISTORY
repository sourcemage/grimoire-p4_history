		Since I don't know how they are going to name pre/rc kernels of
		the test series, might need more fiddling if they are going to
		pre/rc them since I hacked this onto the pre/rc code, though
		it's an easy fix... just wanted to get this in.

		ARCHIVE="off" fix in bugzilla bug #1068, reverting change 13315, 
		keeping 13321

2003-06-01  Seth Woolley <seth@tautology.org>

		Changed md5 of 2.4.20 xfs patch, as it changed (other
		versions stayed the same) -- xfs people have been known
		to do this.

2003-05-17  Chris Brien <cbrien@sourcemage.org>

2003-02-27  Eric Sandall <eric@sandall.us>

		Added support for Sparc systems

		Changed case statement in UPDATE_BOOTLOADER to use `uname -m`
		as $BUILD is not defined yet

2003-01-08  Seth Woolley <seth@tautology.org>

		Added MD5 and GPG support to everything.  Now
		nothing should be downloaded from this spell
		without some sort of verification.

		GPG was chosen because the spell allows one to arbitrarily 
		pick CUSTOM kernels, and kernel.org already has
		a .sign file for every regular file.

		PRE_BUILD, DETAILS, HISTORY modified

		MD5PATCH, GPGPATCH added

		CONFIGURE changed to PREPARE and modified

		kernel.gpg (for kernel.org) added.
		grsecurity.gpg (for grsecurity.org) added.

		All patches/* have all MD5s filled in and line added
		to call MD5PATCH script, unless gpg would work on them
		as those have a GPGPATCH call instead and their
		PUBRINGFILE variable set.

		ck split into ck and ck_extras.

		Various patches were updated.

		Raven framebuffer made optional and put in patches/

		If gpg is not found, it will explain steps to get around
		a lack of gnupg, even if no kernel headers exist.

		Made HISTORY file smgl-compliant.

		Wolfgang debugged and helped immensely.

2002-12-12  Wolfgang Scheicher <worf@sbox.tu-graz.ac.at>

		Finally removed the last "build after linux" spells from 
		the list so they are forced to use TRIGGERS

		sorcery

2002-09-06  Wolfgang Scheicher <worf@sbox.tu-graz.ac.at>
