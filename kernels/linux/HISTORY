		ARCHIVE="off" fix in bugzilla bug #1068, reverting change 13315, 
		keeping 13321

2003-06-01  Seth Woolley <seth@tautology.org>

		Changed md5 of 2.4.20 xfs patch, as it changed (other
		versions stayed the same) -- xfs people have been known
		to do this.

2003-05-23  Seth Woolley <seth@tautology.org>

		Added ioperm patch for security fix, other part of 3362.

2003-05-17  Chris Brien <cbrien@sourcemage.org>

		The spell now respects INSTALL_ROOT and HOST.

2003-05-16  Seth Woolley <seth@tautology.org>

		Changed checkmd5() routine to match our interpreted URL setup
		(BTW, that's totally borked, but that's sorcery's fault)
		Added hashDoS patch for security fix. part of bug #3362.

2003-02-27  Eric Sandall <eric@sandall.us>

		Added support for Sparc systems

		Changed case statement in UPDATE_BOOTLOADER to use `uname -m`
		as $BUILD is not defined yet

2003-01-08  Seth Woolley <seth@tautology.org>

		Added MD5 and GPG support to everything.  Now
		nothing should be downloaded from this spell
		without some sort of verification.

		GPG was chosen because the spell allows one to arbitrarily 
		pick CUSTOM kernels, and kernel.org already has
		a .sign file for every regular file.

		PRE_BUILD, DETAILS, HISTORY modified

		MD5PATCH, GPGPATCH added

		CONFIGURE changed to PREPARE and modified

		kernel.gpg (for kernel.org) added.
		grsecurity.gpg (for grsecurity.org) added.

		All patches/* have all MD5s filled in and line added
		to call MD5PATCH script, unless gpg would work on them
		as those have a GPGPATCH call instead and their
		PUBRINGFILE variable set.

		ck split into ck and ck_extras.

		Various patches were updated.

		Raven framebuffer made optional and put in patches/

		If gpg is not found, it will explain steps to get around
		a lack of gnupg, even if no kernel headers exist.

		Made HISTORY file smgl-compliant.

		Wolfgang debugged and helped immensely.

2002-12-12  Wolfgang Scheicher <worf@sbox.tu-graz.ac.at>

		Finally removed the last "build after linux" spells from 
		the list so they are forced to use TRIGGERS

2002-09-21  Wolfgang Scheicher <worf@sbox.tu-graz.ac.at>

		Fixed some Variable names to make the spell work with new 
		sorcery

2002-09-06  Wolfgang Scheicher <worf@sbox.tu-graz.ac.at>

		Finally replacing old kernel spells by this one

2002-08-20  Wolfgang Scheicher <worf@sbox.tu-graz.ac.at>

		Rewrite - Attempt to merge several kernel spells into one
	  	Now features a menu to select which version to build
