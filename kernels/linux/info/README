Okay this is the first release of the new linux spell.
Check it out if you want to add files that would be helpful.

Notes on making the files for patches:
FILE NAME: should reflect the uncompressed filename
patchversion: should reflect the the modified version if `uname -r` changes to something different you should have this var
source: should reflect the full name of the file being downloaded
md5sum: is the md5sum of the uncompressed patch
source_url: is the web/ftp site you download the source from
appliedkernels: this is a space separated list of kernels the patch can apply to
pval: is the -p# number passed to patch // this will be a default value of 1 create this only to overwrite that
post_patch: space separated list of patches that need applying after the current patch is applied
depends: space separated list of patches that the current patch depends on
short: short description of the patch

finally put them in an appropriate folder under the ${SCRIPT_DIRECTORY}/info/patches/ directory if one doesn't exist create one.

Notes on making the files for kernels:
FILE NAME: should reflect the kernel version being downloaded
version: should also reflect the kernel version being downloaded
source: should reflect the file being downloaded
source_url: should reflect the web/ftp site you download the source from
md5sum: should be the md5sum of the uncompressed source
