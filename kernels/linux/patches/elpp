DESCRIPTION="Enhanced Linux Progress Patch"
SHORT="Hide the boot messages and show a logo"
HELP="ELPP (Enhanced Linux Progress Patch) is a patch to the Linux Kernel. It hides the boot messages and shows a logo, a progressbar and a few configurable messages with success, warning and failure icons instead.
It was originally created by Prasad and based upon LPP. Since it doesn't seem to be maintained anymore, I updated the patch to a more up to date kernel version and released a new package here.
For more information about the usage of ELPP have a look at the documentation included in the package.

You'll need to install the program elpp and modify your init scripts, initrd image, and boot options.
