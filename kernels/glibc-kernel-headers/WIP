	* headers from 2.4.24 or 2.6.1 ,both vanilla ,both with autoconf.h config.h guts removed.
	 both with "#error blablabla: added to autoconf.h and modversions.h so kernel modules will positively fail 
	if they incorrectly use them instead of headers from the source tree.
	* 2.6.1 patched with arwed's and my patch from glibc spell. That patch actually removes an ifdef __KERNEL__ ... #endif
	from list.h so some of the common stuff is available for other headers to use. THis is not perfect but does 
	solve the fb.h problems. other problems wtill need solving.
	* I would appreciate someone with actual coding skills looking at the last part of BUILD and the 
	corresponding define in config.h, 2.4 kernels didn't have a reliance on a value for this but I don't know 
	enough to fix this any other way.
