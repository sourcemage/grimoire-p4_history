NetPIPE is a protocol independent performance tool that encapsulates
the best of ttcp and netperf and visually represents the network
performance under a variety of conditions. By taking the end-to-end
application view of a network, NetPIPE clearly shows the overhead
associated with different protocol layers.

Interfaces are available for TCP, PVM and MPI.

Netpipe answers such questions as: 
how soon will a given data block of size k arrive at its destination? 
which network and protocol will transmit size k blocks the fastest? 
what is a given network's effective maximum throughput and saturation level?  
does there exist a block size k for which the throughput is maximized? 
how much communication overhead is due to the network comm. protocol layer(s)? 
how quickly will a small (< 1 kbyte) control message arrive, 
and which network and protocol are best for this purpose?
