cat << EOF
Keepalived for LVS aims to add a strong and robust keepalive facility to 
the Linux Virtual Server project. This project is written in C with 
multilayer TCP/IP stack checks. It implements a framework based on three 
family checks: Layer3, Layer4, and Layer5. This framework gives the daemon 
the ability of checking a LVS server pool states.When one of the servers in 
the LVS server pool is down, keepalived informs the Linux kernel via a 
setsockopt call to remove this server entry from the LVS topology. In 
addition, it implements a VRRPv2 stack to handle director failover.
