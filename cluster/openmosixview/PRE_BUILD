# have emailed the author of OMV so hopefully this can be removed soon
# you can't just do an ./configure because it looks for QT < 3.x?
# and with SMGL using new libs and no way of nicely installing older ones.
# You try aclocal autoconf but autoconf errs because
# acinclued.m4 which has all the KDE macros is for an older version.
# After looking at the dev notes & CVS on the KDE site  
# you need the admin dir as its for some super build. 
# Copied admin,acinclude.m4, modified configure.in to work again
# and after all this it actually compiles :-)    
# but it's not at all nice...
# thanks to Matt the updated build scripts for 1.4 are all  
# fine except for the collector & view
