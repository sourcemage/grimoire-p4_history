cat << EOF
openMosix is a Linux kernel extension for single-system image clustering. Taking n PC boxes, 
openMosix gives users and applications the illusion of one single computer with n CPUs. 
openMosix is perfectly scalable and adaptive.

This spell will enable openMosix on this machine. Cast it on every other machine in the cluster.

This spell requires the openMosix kernel patch to be applied, and for each kernel to be built 
with the same openMosix configuration.
