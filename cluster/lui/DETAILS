The Linux Utility for cluster Installation (LUI) is an open source 
utility for installing Linux workstations remotely, over an ethernet 
network. What distinguishes LUI is that it is "resource based". LUI 
provides tools to manage installation resources on the server, that 
can be allocated and applied to installing clients, allowing users 
to select just which resources are right for each client. Examples 
of resources supported in LUI 1.1 are the the linux kernel and 
associated system map, the disk partition table, RPMs, user exits, 
and local and remote (NFS) file systems. LUI supports both the BOOTP 
protocol for diskette based client installation, as well as true 
network installation, using DHCP and PXE.
