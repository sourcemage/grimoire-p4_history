cat << EOF
procstatd is a daemon that can be run either from userspace or inetd 
that can be queried via a simple API to parse various files in /proc
and transform them into statistics. The returned data is in a simply 
parsable ASCII string (in a single packet) and might be used to, for 
example, drive a simple display. The nice thing about it is that by 
running procstatd's on all nodes of a beowulf or cluster, users or 
managers can (with suitable front-end tools) see what the loads and 
so forth are. The package contains also a perl script (webwatchd) 
for generating a simple html page with the statistics of the nodes.
