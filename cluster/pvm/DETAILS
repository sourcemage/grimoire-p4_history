PVM (Parallel Virtual Machine) is a software package that permits a heterogeneous
collection of Unix and/or NT computers hooked together by a network to be used as 
a single large parallel computer. Thus large computational problems can be solved 
more cost effectively by using the aggregate power and memory of many computers.
