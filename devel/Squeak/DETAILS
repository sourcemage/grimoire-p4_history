cat << EOF
Squeak is a new OpenSource and super portable Smalltalk-80-based
language by Smalltalk's inventors, the original Xerox PARC, Alan Kay
team, now at Disney. It runs on many platforms, including Linux x86 & 
PowerPC. Now uses Self language's Morphic User Interface toolkit.
Next to universal access, malleability is the prime figure of merit
for Squeak. It is intended that Squeak evolve.
