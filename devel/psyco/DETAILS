           SHORT="Psyco is a Python extension module which can massively speed up the execution of any Python code."
cat << EOF
Think of Psyco as a kind of just-in-time (JIT) compiler, a little bit like
Java's, that emit machine code on the fly instead of interpreting your Python
program step by step. The difference is that Psyco writes several version of
the same blocks (a block is a bit of a function), which are optimized by
being specialized to some kinds of variables (a "kind" can mean a type, but
it is more general). The result is that your unmodified Python programs
run faster.
