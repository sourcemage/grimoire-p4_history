The Bazaar project

Welcome to the Bazaar project, sponsored by Canonical Limited.

Mission statement
Bazaar will:
  * be an implementation of the GNU Arch protocol that open source developers both want to use, and love using
  * Retain compatability with the GNU Arch protocol as it evolves
  * Work with the GNU Arch community process for any protocol changes that might be required for user friendliness.

Key Bazaar features:
  * All the transparent and robust storage features of GNU Arch.
  * seamless upgrade path to bazaar-ng
  * direct support for URLs - one command can checkout or merge from remote locations.
  * integrated GPG support - zero setup for most signed archive situations
  * faster - checkout, most local operations, commits
  * svn-like diff, switch, import, export, log commands
  * Explicit tracking of conflicts, preventing accidental commits of files with conflicts
  * single merge command that allows merging between arbitrary branches.
  * daily builds of the latest code.
  * fully compatible with tla - drop in and start using
  * supports debian version numbers in branch names
  * annotate support
  * internationalised via gettext and Rosetta.
  * Python bindings.
