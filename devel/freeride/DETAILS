FreeRIDE is an Integrated Development Environment for Ruby language.
The goal of FreeRIDE is simple, yet ambitious: to become THE cross-platform IDE of choice for the Ruby community. We 
want FreeRIDE to be a first-class IDE on par with those available for other languages. These goals include:

* '''Cross-Platform''' -- FreeRIDE will run on as many platforms as possible (currently runs on Linux, Windows and Mac 
OS X).
* '''International''' -- FreeRIDE will be easily translated into other languages and will include features that make it 
easier to develop Ruby applications that can be internationalized. (to be done)
* '''Plugin Architecture''' -- FreeRIDE's plugin architecture will make it easy for any developer to extend the features 
of FreeRIDE.
* '''Extreme Programming''' -- FreeRIDE will include features that make it easy to use many practices that have been 
popularized by the Extreme Programming method. This will include collaboration support for remote pair programming, unit 
testing support for test-first coding, refactoring support, and more.
* '''Code Editing & Navigation''' -- All the now-standard code editing and navigation features you would find in any 
high-end IDE, including syntax highlighting, code completion, template expansion, class browsing, etc.
