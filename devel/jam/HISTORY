	* Bug from http://forums.sourcemage.org/viewtopic.php?p=3914
	* DETAILS: Fixed md5sum (.zip changed)
	  Removed MAINTAINER
	  Shortened SHORT
	  Added BUILD_API=2
	* BUILD: Converted to BUILD_API 2
	* INSTALL: Added
	* PRE_BUILD: Added (no longer uncompresses to a directory)

2003-11-29 Eric Sandall <eric@sandall.us>
	* DETAILS: Updated to 2.5
	  Changed .tar to .zip, as Sorcery seems to have problems with uncompressed
	  archives (http://forums.sourcemage.org/viewtopic.php?t=410)
	  Removed the HTTP URL, as it no longer exists
	* HISTORY: Formatted to Guru Handbook

2003-05-14 Seth Woolley <seth@tautology.org>
	* Removed PRE_BUILD since uncompressed tars do in fact
	  work with default_pre_build, fixing unpack() issue as a 
	  sideeffect.
