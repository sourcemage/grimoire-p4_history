cat << EOF
pgAdmin boasts the following features and more:

User
* Explorer-like interface for browsing an entire PostgreSQL server in one session.
* DSN-less connections with most recently used list for quick re-connects.
* Creators/editors for users, groups, databases, aggregates, functions, indexes,
  languages, operators, rules, sequences, tables, triggers, types & views.
* Arbitrary SQL entry/execution to edittable datagrid or plugin 'Exporter' modules
  including Microsoft Excel, ASCII Text & HTML.
* Plugin architecture with the following included plugins:
  o Connection Debugging Tools
  o Import Wizard
  o MSysConf Wizard
  o Database Publishing Wizard
  o Security Wizard
* Object reverse engineering displays the SQL required to recreate the selected
  object. The entire schema of a database can be quickly saved to a file.
* SQL Query Wizard.
* Larger textboxes can be expanded to fill the parent window and have auto
  keyword highlighting (user  configurable).
* Online help includes the standard PostgreSQL manuals.
* Upgrade Wizard can periodically check for new versions of pgAdmin, PostgreSQL
  and the psqlODBC driver.
* Auto-scrolling log window shows logs whilst pgAdmin is running. Log Window may
  be made 'Always on Top'.

Technical
* Highly structured object oriented design.
* Underlying pgSchema library presents the PostgreSQL server as a hierarchical
  object model. Updatable properties and methods allow updating of the database.
* Extensive use of caching and 'populate on demand' minimises server load and
  maximises response time.
* Five different logging levels including None, Errors only, Errors and SQL
  queries, Debug and Full Debug. Debug level enables the psqlODBC Commlog, and
  Full Debug also enables the MyLog.
* Two Plugin types allow the use of plugins that require a connection to
  a database and others that don't.
