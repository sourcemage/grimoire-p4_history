Doxygen can generate an on-line documentation browser (in HTML) and/or
an off-line reference manual (in LaTeX) from a set of [un]documented
source files. There is also support for generating output in RTF
(MS-Word), PostScript, hyperlinked PDF, compressed HTML, and Unix man
pages. The documentation is extracted directly from the sources, which
makes it much easier to keep the documentation consistent with the
source code.
