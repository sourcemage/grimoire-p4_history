From http://oss.software.ibm.com/developerworks/opensource/jikes

JikesTM is a compiler that translates Java source files 
as defined in The Java Language Specification into the 
bytecoded instruction set and binary format defined in
The Java Virtual Machine Specification.

You may wonder why the world needs another Java compiler, 
considering that Sun provides javac free with its SDK. 
Jikes has four advantages that make it a valuable 
contribution to the Linux and Java communities:
   
1.) Open source. 

        Jikes is OSI Certified Open Source Software. 
        OSI Certified is a certification mark of the 
        Open Source Initiative.  

2.) Strictly Java compatible. 

        Jikes strives to adhere to both The Java
        Language Specification and The Java Virtual 
        Machine Specification as tightly as possible, 
        and does not support subsets, supersets, or
        other variations of the language. The FAQ describes
        some of the side effects of this strict language 
        conformance.

3.) High performance. 

        Jikes is a high performance compiler, making
        it ideal for use with larger projects.

4.) Dependency analysis. 
 
        Jikes performs a dependency analysis on
        your code that provides two very useful features: 
        Incremental builds and makefile generation.
