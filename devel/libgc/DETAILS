cat << EOF
The Boehm-Demers-Weiser conservative garbage collector can be used as a garbage collecting replacement 
for C malloc or C++ new. It is also used by a number of programming language implementations that use 
C as intermediate code.Alternatively, it may be used as a leak detector for C or C++ programs, though 
that is not its primary goal.
