cat << EOF
Scsh is a Unix shell embedded in Scheme. It provides full access to
POSIX as well as extensions common to most Unix implementations. Scsh
also features many abstractions to ease system programming: process
abstraction, event-based interrupt handling, sophisticated I/O support
and enables concurrent system programming.
Scsh is built on top of Scheme 48, a portable R5RS compliant Scheme
implementation with byte-code compilation, user-level threads, and
many useful extensions.
