cat << EOF
pkg-config is a system for managing library compile/link flags that
works with automake and autoconf. It replaces the ubiquitous *-config
scripts you may have seen with a single tool. There's nothing
desktop-specific or desktop-related about pkg-config, despite it being
on freedesktop.org.
