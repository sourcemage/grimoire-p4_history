	* PRE_BUILD, DEPENDS, WIP: removed
	* CONFLICTS: added conflict on itself
	* BUILD, DETAILS: deprecated spell, it's a pain to get working and
	  doesn't buy as anything, as mono already includes everything mcs
	  would install, and all that stuff is CLI bytecode anyway, so recompiling
	  it is useless
