cat << EOF
ccache is a compiler cache. It acts as a caching pre-processor to
C/C++ compilers, using the -E compiler switch and a hash to detect
when a compilation can be satisfied from cache. This often results in
a 5 to 10 times speedup in common compilations.

The idea came from Erik Thiele wrote the original compilercache
program as a bourne shell script. ccache is a re-implementation of
Erik's idea in C with more features and better performance.
