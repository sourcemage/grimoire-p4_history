cat << EOF
SPYCE is a server-side engine that supports simple and efficient
Python-based dynamic HTML generation. Those who like Python and are familiar
with JSP, or PHP, or ASP, should have a look at this engine. It allows one
to generate dynamic HTML content just as easily, using Python for the
dynamic parts. Its modular design makes it very flexible and extensible. It
can also be used as a command-line utility for HTML pre-processing.
