cat << EOF
monotone is a free, distributed version control system. it provides
fully disconnected operation, manages complete tree versions, keeps
its state in a local transactional database, supports overlapping
branches and extensible metadata, exchanges work over plain network
protocols, performs history-sensitive merging, and delegates trust
functions to client-side RSA certificates.
