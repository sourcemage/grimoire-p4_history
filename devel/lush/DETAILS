cat << EOF
Lush is an object-oriented programming language designed for researchers, 
experimenters, and engineers interested in large-scale numerical and 
graphic applications. Lush is designed to be used in situations 
where one would want to combine the flexibility of a high-level, 
weakly-typed interpreted language, with the efficiency of a strongly-typed, 
natively-compiled language, and with the easy integration of code written 
in C, C++, or other languages.
