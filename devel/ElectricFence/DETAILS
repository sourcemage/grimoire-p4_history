cat << EOF
Electric Fence is a different kind of malloc() debugger. It uses the
virtual memory hardware of your system to detect when software
overruns the boundaries of a malloc() buffer. It will also detect any
accesses of memory that has been released by free(). Because it uses
the VM hardware for detection, Electric Fence stops your program on
the first instruction that causes a bounds violation. It's then
trivial to use a debugger to display the offending statement.
