cat << EOF
Frost allows you to use multi methods and virtual function arguments
in your C++ programs as if they were a native C++ feature. It is a
compiler wrapper which modifies compiler input and output files and
collects information about defined classes and functions which is
stored in a separate 'frost-object' file for each assembler or object
file that is generated by the compiler. When linking is done this
information is used to generate the dispatching code.
