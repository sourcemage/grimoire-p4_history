software projects. Darcs is decentralized, based on a "theory of patches"
with roots in quantum mechanics. Darcs is free software, licensed under
the GPL.

Written in Haskell, darcs is used on on many operating systems including
Linux, MacOS X, FreeBSD, and Windows. Darcs includes a CGI script to
browse your repository from the web.
