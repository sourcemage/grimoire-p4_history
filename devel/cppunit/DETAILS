CppUnit is the C++ port of the famous JUnit framework for unit testing. Test output 
is in XML or text format for automatic testing and GUI based for supervised tests.

Automated unit-level testing is an essential ingredient to continuous
integration and Extreme Programming. Remember, "The fewer test cases you write, 
the less stable your code base becomes."
