diffutils - Finds differences between and among files
A group of utilities that displays difference between and among text
files.
'diff' outputs the difference between two files in any of several
formats. If the files are identical, it normally produces no ouput; if
they are binary (non-text) it normally reports only that they are
different.
'cmp' shows the offsets and files numbers where two files differ; it can
also show, side by side, all the characters that differ between the two
files.
'sdiff' merges two files interactively.
'diff3' shows differences among three files. If two people have made
independent changes to a common original, diff3 reports that difference
between the original and the two changed versions, and can produce a
merged file that contains both persons' changes along with warnings
about conflicts.
