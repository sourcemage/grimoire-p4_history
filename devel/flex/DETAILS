Flex is a fast lexical analyser generator. It is a tool for
generating programs that perform pattern-matching on text. There are
many applications for Flex, including writing compilers in
conjunction with GNU Bison. Flex is a free implementation of the well 
known Lex program. It features a Lex compatibility mode, and also
provides several new features such as exclusive start conditions.
