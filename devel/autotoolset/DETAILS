The autotoolset package (former autotools package) complements the GNU
build system by providing the following features:

* Automatic generation of legal notices that are needed in order to apply
  the GNU GPL license

* Automatic generation of directory trees for new software packages,
  such that they conform to the GNITS standard (more or less).

* Some rudimentary portability framework for C++ programs. There is a
  lot of room for improvement here, in the future. Also a framework for
  embedding text into your executable and handling include files accross
  multiple directories.

* Support for writing portable software that uses both Fortran and C++.

* Additional support for writing software documentation in Texinfo,
  but also in LaTeX.

* A manual introducing both Autotools and the GNU build system in a
  unified task-oriented manner.
