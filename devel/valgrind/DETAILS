cat << EOF
Valgrind is a GPL'd tool to help you find memory-management problems in your
programs. When a program is run under Valgrind's supervision, all reads and
writes of memory are checked, and calls to malloc/new/free/delete are
intercepted. As a result, Valgrind can detect problems such as:
* Use of uninitialised memory
* Reading/writing memory after it has been free'd
* Reading/writing off the end of malloc'd blocks
* Reading/writing inappropriate areas on the stack
* Memory leaks -- where pointers to malloc'd blocks are lost forever
* Passing of uninitialised and/or unaddressible memory to system calls
* Mismatched use of malloc/new/new [] vs free/delete/delete []
* Some misuses of the POSIX pthreads API
