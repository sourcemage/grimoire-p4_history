currently broken, need to add cvs support for gtk-sharp

monodevelop wants a newer version of gtk-sharp than unstable version on sourceforge

error:

checking for gtk-sharp-2.0 >= 1.9.5... Package gtk-sharp-2.0 was not found in
the pkg-config search path. Perhaps you should add the directory containing
`gtk-sharp-2.0.pc' to the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable No package
'gtk-sharp-2.0' found
configure: error: Library requirements (gtk-sharp-2.0 >= 1.9.5) not met;
consider adjusting the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable if your libraries
are in a nonstandard prefix so pkg-config can find them.
