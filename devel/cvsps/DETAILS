CVSps is a program for generating 'patchset' information from 
a CVS repository. A patchset in this case is defined as a set 
of changes made to a collection of files, and all committed at 
the same time (using a single 'cvs commit' command). This 
information is valuable to seeing the big picture of the 
evolution of a cvs project. While cvs tracks revision 
information, it is often difficult to see what changes were 
committed 'atomically' to the repository.
