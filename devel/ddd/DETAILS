GNU DDD is a graphical front-end for command-line debuggers
such as GDB, DBX, WDB, Ladebug, JDB, XDB, the Perl debugger, or the
Python debugger. Besides ``usual'' front-end features such as viewing
source texts, DDD has become famous through its interactive graphical
data display, where data structures are displayed as graphs.
