Greg is a framework for testing other programs and libraries. Its purpose is to
provide a single front end for all tests and to be a small, simple framework 
for writing tests. Greg leverages off the Guile language to provide all the 
power (and more) of other test frameworks with greater simplicity and ease of 
use.
