The GNU Debugger (GDB) is a source-level debugger for C, C++, Java,
Modula-2, and several other languages. It runs on GNU/Linux, the
BSD's, and almost every major proprietary OS. GDB can debug programs
running on the same machine as itself, or it can communicate over a
network or serial line with a debugging stub on another machine;
thus, it can be used for embedded and kernel debugging.
