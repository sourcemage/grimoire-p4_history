cat << EOF
nhc98 is a fully-fledged compiler for Haskell 98, the standard lazy
functional programming language. Written in Haskell, it is small and
very portable, and aims to produce small executables that run in small
amounts of memory. Is a pattern becoming obvious here? :-) It also
comes with extensive tool support for automatic compilation, foreign
language interfacing, heap and time profiling, tracing, and debugging.
