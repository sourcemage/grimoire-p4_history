Tiny C Compiler - C Scripting Everywhere - The Smallest Linux C Compiler.

Features:
    * SMALL! You can compile and execute C code everywhere, for example on rescue disks (about 100KB for x86 TCC executable, including C preprocessor, C compiler, assembler and linker).
    * FAST! tcc generates optimized x86 code. No byte code overhead. Compile, assemble and link several times faster than GCC.
    * UNLIMITED! Any C dynamic library can be used directly. TCC is heading torward full ISOC99 compliance. TCC can of course compile itself.
    * SAFE! tcc includes an optional memory and bound checker. Bound checked code can be mixed freely with standard code.
    * Compile and execute C source directly. No linking or assembly necessary. Full C preprocessor and GNU-like assembler included.
    * C script supported : just add '#!/usr/local/bin/tcc -run' at the first line of your C source, and execute it directly from the command line.
    * With libtcc, you can use TCC as a backend for dynamic code generation.
