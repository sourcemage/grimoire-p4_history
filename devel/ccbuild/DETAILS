ccbuild is like a dynamic Makefile. ccbuild finds all programs in the current
directory (containing &quot;int main&quot;) and compiles them. For this, it
reads the C++ sources and looks at all local and global includes. All C++
files surrounding local includes are considered objects for the main program.
The global includes lead to extra compiler arguments using a configuration file.
ccbuild splits these arguments for compilation and linking, keeping the linking
arguments back for later use. It should allow development without any scripting
and only simple reusable configuration. Real deployment/distribution should
still be done with other tools. As an added bonus, it can create simple
Makefiles and graph dependencies using DOT (graphviz) graphs.
