cat << EOF
Gforth is a fast and portable implementation of the ANS Forth
language. It works nicely with the Emacs editor, offers some
nice features such as input completion and history and a powerful
locals facility and it even has (the beginnings of) a manual.
Gforth employs traditional implementation techniques: its inner
interpreter is indirect or direct threaded.
