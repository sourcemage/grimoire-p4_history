cat << EOF
The CDT (C/C++ Development Tools) Project is working towards providing a fully
functional C and C++ Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for the Eclipse
platform. 

There are a number of groups contributing to the CDT; We strongly encourage
interested parties to extend our work, thereby making the Eclipse CDT project
a richer set of freely available resources. We are looking for contributions
from the open source community in the areas of test, development,
documentation, and general users who can help us ensure that the C/C++ tools
work well on all the Eclipse platforms.   

Our current release function includes:
  * C/C++ Editor (basic functionality, syntax highlighting, code completion
    etc.)
  * C/C++ Debugger (APIs & Default implementation, using GDB)
  * C/C++ Launcher (APIs & Default implementation, launches and external
    application)
  * Parser
  * Search Engine
  * Content Assist Provider
  * Makefile generator
