cat << EOF
Arch is a really nifty revision control system. It's "whole-tree changeset
based" which means, roughly, that it can handle file and directory adds,
deletes, and renames cleanly, and that it does branching simply and easily.
Arch is also "distributed" which means, for example that you can make arch
branches of your own from remote projects, even if you don't have write access
to the revision control archives for those projects.

tla is a C implementation of Arch.
