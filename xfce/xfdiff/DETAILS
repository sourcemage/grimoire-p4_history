Xfdiff is a graphic interface to the GNU diff and patch commands. 
With this utility, you can view differences side by side for files 
or directories. You can also view differences that applying a patch 
file would imply, without applying the patch. You can also apply 
patches to the hard disc or create patch files for differences between 
files or directories. All-in-all, a handy utility for lazy chaps who 
don't want to type the diff command.
