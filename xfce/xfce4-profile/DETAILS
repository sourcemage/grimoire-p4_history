cat << EOF
XFce 4 is the next generation of XFce desktop. It's the result of more than a
year of development, spent to rewrite all of XFce 4 core components from
scratch. We hope you'll give a try to XFce 4, and that you will report bugs on
xfce4-dev at xfce.org mailing-list, thus we will be able to release the best
final version possible.
