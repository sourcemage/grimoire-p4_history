ANTLR, ANother Tool for Language Recognition, (formerly PCCTS)
is a language tool that provides a framework for constructing 
recognizers, compilers, and translators from grammatical 
descriptions containing Java, C++, or C# actions [You can use 
PCCTS 1.xx to generate C-based parsers].

Computer language translation has become a common task. While 
compilers and tools for traditional computer languages (such as
C or Java) are still being built, their number is dwarfed by 
the thousands of mini-languages for which recognizers and 
translators are being developed. Programmers construct 
translators for database formats, graphical data files (e.g., 
PostScript, AutoCAD), text processing files (e.g., HTML, SGML). 
ANTLR is designed to handle all of your translation tasks.
