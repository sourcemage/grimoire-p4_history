cat << EOF
Jikes is a compiler that translates JavaTM source files as defined in 
The Java Language Specification into the bytecoded instruction set and
binary format defined in The Java Virtual Machine Specification.

You may wonder why the world needs another Java compiler, considering 
that Sun provides javac free with its SDK. Jikes has four advantages 
that make it a valuable contribution to the Java community.

 * Open source. Jikes is OSI Certified Open Source Software. OSI 
   Certified is a certification mark of the Open Source Initiative.
 * Strictly Java compatible. Jikes strives to adhere to both The Java 
   Language Specification and The Java Virtual Machine Specification 
   as tightly as possible, and does not support subsets, supersets, 
   or other variations of the language. The FAQ describes some of the
   side effects of this strict language conformance.
 * High performance. Jikes is a high performance compiler, making it 
   ideal for use with larger projects.
 * Dependency analysis. Jikes performs a dependency analysis on your 
   code that provides two very useful features: Incremental builds and
   makefile generation.
