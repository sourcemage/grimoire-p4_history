Velocity is a Java-based template engine. It permits web page designers 
to reference methods defined in Java code. Web designers can work in 
parallel with Java programmers to develop web sites according to the 
Model-View-Controller (MVC) model, meaning that web page designers can 
focus solely on creating a well-designed site, and programmers can focus
solely on writing top-notch code. Velocity separates Java code from the 
web pages, making the web site more maintainable over the long run and 
providing a viable alternative to Java Server Pages (JSPs) or PHP.

Velocity can be used to generate web pages, SQL, PostScript and other 
output from templates. It can be used either as a standalone utility for 
generating source code and reports, or as an integrated component of 
other systems. When complete, Velocity will provide template services 
for the Turbine web application framework. Velocity+Turbine will provide
a template service that will allow web applications to be developed 
according to a true MVC model.
