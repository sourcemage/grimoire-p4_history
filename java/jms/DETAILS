           SHORT="The Java Message Service (JMS) API."
cat << EOF
Enterprise messaging is now recognized as an essential tool for building 
enterprise applications. By combining Java technology with enterprise 
messaging, the JMS API provides a new, powerful tool for solving 
enterprise computing problems.
 
Enterprise messaging provides a reliable, flexible service for the 
asynchronous exchange of critical business data and events throughout 
an enterprise. The JMS API adds to this a common API and provider framework
that enables the development of portable, message based applications in the 
Java programming language.
 
The JMS API improves programmer productivity by defining a common set of 
messaging concepts and programming strategies that will be supported by all 
JMS technology-compliant messaging systems.
