With the JavaBeans Activation Framework standard extension, developers 
who use Java technology can take advantage of standard services to 
determine the type of an arbitrary piece of data, encapsulate access 
to it, discover the operations available on it, and to instantiate 
the appropriate bean to perform said operation(s). For example, if 
a browser obtained a JPEG image, this framework would enable the browser
to identify that stream of data as an JPEG image, and from that type, 
the browser could locate and instantiate an object that could manipulate,
 or view that image.

The JavaBeans Activation Framework is implemented as a standard extension.
Sun provides a royalty-free reference implementation of the JAF software, 
in binary form, that developers can use to develop JAF technology-enabled 
applications for any platform that supports the Java Development Kit 
(JDKTM) 1.1 software or the JavaTM 2 Standard Edition.
