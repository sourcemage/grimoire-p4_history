cat << EOF
JUnit is a Java testing framework. Since testing is not closely integrated
with development, it prevents you from measuring the progress of development.
You can't tell when something starts working or when something stops working.
Using JUnit you can cheaply and incrementally build a test suite that will 
help you measure your progress, spot unintended side effects, and focus your
 development efforts.
