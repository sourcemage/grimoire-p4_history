           SHORT="Jakarta commons Database Connection Pool."
cat << EOF
Many Jakarta projects support interaction with a relational database.
Creating a new connection for each user can be time consuming (often 
requiring multiple seconds of clock time), in order to perform a 
database transaction that might take milliseconds. Opening a connection
per user can be unfeasible in a publicly-hosted Internet application 
where the number of simultaneous users can be very large. Accordingly,
developers often wish to share a "pool" of open connections between 
all of the application's current users. The number of users actually
performing a request at any given time is usually a very small percentage
of the total number of active users, and during request processing is 
the only time that a database connection is required. The application 
itself logs into the DBMS, and handles any user account issues internally.
 
There are several Database Connection Pools already available, both 
within Jakarta products and elsewhere. This Commons package provides 
an opportunity to coordinate the efforts required to create and maintain
an efficient, feature-rich package under the ASF license.
