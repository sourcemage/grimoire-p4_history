cat << EOF
The goal of this project is to provide an open source framework for 
building web applications.

The core of the Struts framework is a flexible control layer based 
on standard technologies like Java Servlets, JavaBeans, ResourceBundles,
and Extensible Markup Language (XML).

Struts encourages application architectures based on the Model 2 approach,
a variation of the classic Model-View-Controller (MVC) design paradigm. 
Struts provides its own Controller component and integrates with other 
technologies to provide the Model and the View. For the Model, Struts can
interact with any standard data access technology, including Enterprise 
Java Beans, JDBC, and Object Relational Bridge. For the View, Struts works
well with JavaServer Pages, Velocity Templates, XSLT, and other presentation
systems.

The Struts framework provides the invisible underpinnings every professional
web application needs to survive. Struts helps you create an extensible 
development environment for your application, based on published standards
and proven design patterns.
