cat << EOF
There is a great need for debugging and logging information inside of Commons components 
such as HTTPClient and DBCP. However, there are many logging APIs out there and it is 
difficult to choose among them.
    
The Logging package is an ultra-thin bridge between different logging libraries. Commons 
components may use the Logging API to remove compile-time and run-time dependencies on 
any particular logging package, and contributors may write Log implementations for the 
library of their choice.
