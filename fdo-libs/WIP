Just needs testing now...

Can't rename X11 -> x11 due to a section being named x11...
Nor Xv -> xv because of graphics/xv

We can get a list of xlibs from:
http://pdx.freedesktop.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/?cvsroot=xlibs

(that's where I found panoramiext, as it's not listed on their pages but xinerama needs it)
