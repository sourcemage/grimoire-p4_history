XML Catalog Manager (xmlcatmgr in its short form) is a small utility used
to manipulate SGML and XML catalogs. It is extremely small and lightweight,
specially designed to be run from packaging systems. Basically, it allows
adding and removing entries from catalogs, in a completely automated way.

A catalog is a lookup mechanism used to translate entities into other
different entities. They can, for example, map public identifiers to local
files or URIs. This allows you to tell the parser where to look for entities
without having to modify the original document source.
