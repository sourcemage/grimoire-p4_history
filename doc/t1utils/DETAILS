Six free UNIX/Windows command-line tools for dealing with Type 1 fonts.
This is a revision of I. Lee Hetherington's beloved t1utils package.
t1ascii changes PFB (binary) fonts into PFA (ASCII) format;
t1binary goes the opposite direction. t1disasm translates PFBs or PFAs
into a human-readable and -editable format;
t1asm goes the opposite direction.
Finally, t1unmac (formerly unpost) translates a Macintosh Type 1 font into
either PFB or PFA format, and t1mac goes the opposite direction.
