Poemscol numbers lines of verse, makes separate endnote sections for
emendations, collations, and explanatory notes, with notes tied to the line
numbers, marks cases where stanza breaks fall on page breaks. Poemscol provides
most of the features necessary for an critical edition of a poet's works, such
as described by the MLA Committee on Scholarly Editions.
