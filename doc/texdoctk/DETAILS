Easy access to package documentation.  

A Perl/Tk-based GUI for easy access to package documentation for TeX on Unix
platforms; the databases it uses are based on the texmf/doc subtrees of teTeX
v.1.0.x, but database files for local configurations with modified/extended
directories can be derived from them.  

Note that texdoctk is not a viewer itself, but an interface for finding
documentation files and opening them with the appropriate viewer; so it relies
on appropriate programs to be installed on the system. However, the choice of
these programs can be configured by the sysadmin or user.
