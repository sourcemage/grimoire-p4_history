The Filesystem Hierarchy Standard

This standard enables

    * Software to predict the location of installed files and directories, and
    * Users to predict the location of installed files and directories.

We do this by

    * Specifying guiding principles for each area of the filesystem,
    * Specifying the minimum files and directories required, 
    * Enumerating exceptions to the principles, and
    * Enumerating specific cases where there has been historical conflict.

The FHS document is used by

    * Independent software suppliers to create applications which are FHS
      compliant, and work with distributions which are FHS complaint, 
    * OS creators to provide systems which are FHS compliant, 
    * and Users to understand and maintain the FHS compliance of a system.
