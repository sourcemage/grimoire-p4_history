Dvipdfm is a DVI to PDF translator. Its features include:

    * TeX \special's that approximate the functionality of the PostScript
      pdfmarks used by Adobe Acrobat Distiller. Links, outlines, articles, and
      named destinations are supported, for example.
    * Support for standard DVI specials such as the HyperTeX specials and the
      TPIC specials.
    * Support for thumbnails (with help from GhostScript).
    * Ability to include PDF, PNG, and JPEG files as embedded images. For PDF
      files, only the first page is included. Resources will be embedded from
      the original file as necessary. File inclusion does not work for PDF
      files that store the page contents in several segments in an array.
    * Virtual font support
    * Support for both Type1 and PK fonts.
    * Support for arbitrary linear graphics transformations. Any material on
      the page can be scaled and rotated.
    * A color stack accessible via \special's.
    * Partial font embedding and stream compression for reduced output file
      size
    * Balanced page and destination trees for improved reader access on very
    * large document files.
