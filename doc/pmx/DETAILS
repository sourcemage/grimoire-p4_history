PMX is a preprocessor for MusiXTeX. 

It builds the TeX input file based on a PMX input file in a much simpler
language, making most of the layout decisions by itself. All data are entered
into a single file for the full score, up to 12 parts. An auxilliary program
makes parts from a score. PMX has most of MusiXTeX's functionality, but it also
permits in-line TeX to give access to virtually all of MusiXTeX. For
proof-listening, PMX can make a MIDI file of your score.
