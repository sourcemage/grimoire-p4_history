        :) Spell now seds the man.conf file to do the fixs below
        with half the effort, and no need to relogin to get the man fix.
        Why do the compilcated fixes always occour to you first?

        POST_* files add/remove export MANPAGER="less -sR" to /etc/profile if the 
        less spell is installed, (doesn't have to same problems with this version of groff 
        as less does).
