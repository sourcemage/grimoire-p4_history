        :) Spell now seds the man.conf file to do the fixs below
        with half the effort, and no need to relogin to get the man fix.
        Ehy do the compilcated fixes always occour to you first?

        Back to version 1.18,
        added POST_INSTALL POST_REMOVE and BUILD files
        spell patches Makefile if netpbm is not installed to avoid netpbm dependancy
        POST_* files add/remove export MANPAGER="less -sR" to /etc/profile if the 
        less spell is installed, (doesn't have to same problems with this version of groff 
        as less does).
