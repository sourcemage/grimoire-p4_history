pstotext is a program that works with Ghostscript (version 3.33 or later) to extract 
plain text from PostScript and PDF files (you should have Ghostscript 3.51 or later 
for PDF). 

There are other programs to do this, but they all fail on numerous common examples. 
We've tested pstotext on a wide variety of PostScript files, and for each of them 
pstotext could extract the words correctly (though sometimes the word order was a 
bit strange).
