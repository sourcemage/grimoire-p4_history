cat << EOF
CHMLIB is a library for dealing with Microsoft ITSS/CHM format files. 
Right now, it is a very simple library, but sufficient for dealing with 
all of the .chm files I've come across. Due to the fairly well-designed 
indexing built into this particular file format, even a small library 
is able to gain reasonably good performance indexing into ITSS 
archives.
