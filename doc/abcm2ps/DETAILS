abcm2ps is a package that converts music tunes from ABC format to PostScript.
Based on abc2ps version 1.2.5, it was developed mainly to print baroque organ 
scores that have independant voices played on one or more keyboards, and a 
pedal-board. It introduces many extensions to the ABC language that make it 
suitable for classical music.
