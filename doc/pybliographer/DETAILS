Pybliographer is a tool for managing bibliographic databases. It can be used
for searching, editing, reformatting, etc. In fact, it's a simple framework
that provides easy to use python classes and functions, and therefore
can be extended to many uses (generating HTML pages according to bibliographic
searches, etc).

In addition to the scripting environment, a graphical Gnome interface
is available. It provides powerful editing capabilities, a nice hierarchical
search mechanism, direct insertion of references into LyX and Kile,
direct queries on Medline, and more. It currently supports the following
file formats: BibTeX, ISI, Medline, Ovid, Refer.
