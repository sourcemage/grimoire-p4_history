DocBook Utilities

docbook2{dvi,html,man,pdf,ps,rtf,tex,texi,txt}

The docbook2{format} scripts are simple one-line wrappers to jw. 
They are provided as easy-to-remember names used to convert 
DocBook or other SGML files to the respective format.

jw is a script used to convert DocBook or other SGML files to 
various output formats. It hides most of OpenJade's complexity 
and adds comfortable features.

sgmldiff is used to compare two SGML files and only return the 
differences in the markup. This is especially useful to compare 
files that should be identical except for language differences 
in the content.
