           SHORT="Data compression library with very fast (de-)compression"
cat << EOF
LZO is a portable lossless data compression library written in ANSI C. It offers pretty fast compression and *very* fast
decompression. Decompression requires no memory. In addition there are slower compression levels achieving a quite competitive
compression ratio while still decompressing at this very high speed.
