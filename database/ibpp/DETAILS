IBPP, where 'PP' stands for '++', is a C++ client interface for 
Firebird Server versions 1.0, 1.5 and further. It also works with 
InterBase® 6.0, though it is expected it might only support Firebird 
in the future. It is a class library, free of any specific 
development tool dependancies. It is not tied to any 'visual' or 
'RAD' tool. It was indeed developed to add Firebird access in any 
C++ application. Those applications using IBPP can be non-visual 
(CORBA/COM objects, other libraries of classes and functions, 
procedural 'legacy' code, for instance). But it can of course also 
be used in visual or RAD environments. IBPP is indeed purely a 
dynamic SQL interface to Firebird. In some easy (we think so :-) to 
use C++ classes, you will find nearly all what is needed to access a 
Firebird database, and manipulate the data. IBPP also offers access 
to most of the administrations tasks : creating a database, 
modifying its structure, performing online backups, administering 
user accounts on the server and so on.
