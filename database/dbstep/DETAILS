cat << EOF
DBStep is a library targeted at C++ developers who need to access 
databases. It consists of a common set of interface classes and some 
drivers for common data sources. Currently available drivers are for 
MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, Firebird/Interbase, and ODBC databases. 
Database access is provided in at two levels: unified API for 
database connection, SQL execution, query result retrieval, and 
methods for mapping class objects to database tables and query 
results.
