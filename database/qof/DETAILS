QOF - Query Object Framework is a library for adding a query engine
to C applications.  An SQL database is not needed; any collection
of C/C++ objects can act as 'tables' which can be 'joined' using
an SQL-like programming interface.

QOF is an offshoot of the GnuCash engine, consisting of those pieces
unrelated to accounting.  The Query Engine allows C/C++ applications
to treat random collections of objects as if they were SQL tables,
and perform table-join type queries across them.  In addition, the
query engine can be backed by an actual database, so that instances
of local objects can act as a 'cache' to a much larger SQL database.

QOF also includes other utilities from GnuCash:
 o Key-Value Pair trees (KVP aka slots and frames), for providing
   extensibility by associating arbitrary-format data with an object,
   using a URL-like identifier.
 o Universally-unique 128-bit ID support, so that an instance of an
   object can be obtained from its unique identifier, thus simplifying
   associations, cross-network operation, etc.
 o Rational Number Support, providing exact math for working with
   money or prices or other quantities.
 o Miscellaneous date & time utilities.
 o Program tracing infrastructure; handing for tracing/debugging
   complex applications.
 o QofBook merge support with collision handling.
 o Support for partial books with references to linked objects.
 o XML backend available to all programs using QOF. A generic format
   to describe any object in XML.
 o Methods to convert objects between applications.

The system consists of 15 KLOC of C code that has been ported to many
Unixes, including Mac OS X.  Although this code is in production use
in stable versions of GnuCash, the split-off into QOF is recent and
still under some flux in order to flesh it out.  In particular, the
subroutine naming convention is being resolved but is still inconsistent.
