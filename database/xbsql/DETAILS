cat << EOF
XBSQL is a wrapper library which provides an SQL-subset interface
to Xbase DBMS, built against xbase-1.8.1. This is the first release, so
various things are still missing, however I think there is now
sufficient functionality to make the library useful. In particular,
the documentation is a bit thin. There is a simple command-line client
xql which can be used as an example.
