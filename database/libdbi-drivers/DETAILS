SHORT="libdbi-drivers project maintains drivers for libdbi"
cat << EOF
libdbi implements a database-independent abstraction layer in C, similar to the 
DBI/DBD layer in Perl. Writing one generic set of code, programmers can 
leverage the power of multiple databases and multiple simultaneous database 
connections by using this framework. 

The libdbi-drivers project maintains drivers for libdbi. Drivers are 
distributed seperately from the library itself. 


There are currently drivers for MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, and mSQL. More are 
on the way.
