Crimson Fields is a tactical war game in the tradition of Battle Isle. Two players command their units on a map of hexagons, trying to accomplish mission objectives ranging from defending important locations to simply destroying all enemy forces. Damaged units may be repaired or replaced by new recruits, while victorious squadrons will improve their abilities so they will be even more difficult to beat next time.

The game can be played against a human adversary in hot-seat mode or via e-mail, or against a simple computer opponent.

The included editor can be used to create your own custom battlefields.
