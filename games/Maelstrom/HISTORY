2003-01-25  Eric Sandall <eric@sandall.us>

		Added a BUILD to install data files into /usr/share/games
		rather than /usr/games, since I don't know configure
		all that well, the path has to be set to /usr/bin, so 
		I cannot install that into /usr/games, as it should be.

		Updated to 3.0.6  (Bug #2379, thanks to Snakebyte)
