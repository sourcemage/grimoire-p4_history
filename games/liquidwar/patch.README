I'm aware of this problem, it should be corrected in the current
CVS tree on Savannah. Point is that "man install-info" gave me the
wrong options - whereas "infodir --help" gives the right answer,
and my Debian Woody box understands both --info-dir and --infodir,
so it never complained.

Several Red Hat 7.2 users already reported this problem, which
will of course be fixed in 5.5.0.
