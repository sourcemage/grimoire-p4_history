		New version: 1.35 (thanks Jeremy Kolb <jkolb@brandeis.edu>)

		Binary now goes into /usr/games and man page into
		/usr/share/man/man6 (FHS compliance) : a patch was needed.

		/usr/games and /usr/share/man/man6 are now created if needed.

		Note: I considered that spell as a game for the FHS, I hope I
		was right.
