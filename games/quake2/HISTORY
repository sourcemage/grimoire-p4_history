		Moved the installation of the game data into POST_INSTALL
		and POST_REMOVE. This means the game data is not tracked,
		so that "cast --fix" will pass if the cdrom isn't mounted.
		Also, it doesn't try to tar up 400 meg of game data in a
		200 meg tmpfs /tmp.

		Initial version using relnevs source.
