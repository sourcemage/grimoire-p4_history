The Flight Gear Flight Simulator project is a free, open-source,
multi-platform, cooperative flight sim development project. Source code
for the entire project is available and licensed under the GPL. The
Flight Gear project is working to create a sophisticated flight
simulator framework for the development and pursuit of interesting
flight simulator ideas. We are developing a good basic sim that can be
expanded and improved upon by anyone interested in contributing.
