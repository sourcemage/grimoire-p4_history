		Now creates /var/lib/games, if doesn't exist,
		with root.games permissions

		Unpacks compressed media files from the $SOURCE2

		Updated UPDATED so users have necessary directories
		and uncompressed media to play (no errors, now,
		when loading freecraft)

		Fixed Bug #1427 (so far, only the
		X11 video option is verified to work)

		Still need to make option to use CD data

		Modified to use our optimizations, rather than just -O2
