		http://www.multimania.com/hosxe/ went 404 therefore updated
		SOURCE_URL[0] and WEB_SITE.

		Added workaround for the compilation to succeed
		(CPPFLAGS='-I/usr/include/libpng'). Added libpng to DEPENDS.

		/usr/games is created if needed.

		Man pages are now installed in /usr/share/man (FHS compliance).
