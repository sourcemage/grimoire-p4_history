2003-03-03  Eric Sandall <eric@sandall.us>

		Added standard sounds  (Bug #441, the fix of which somehow got lost)
		Decided to just add stdsounds to current freeciv spell instead of
		having separate spell just for sounds.  Now sound will always be
		downloaded and installed.  Will separate into freeciv-stdsounds at a
		later time, since there are many other themed sounds to have installed.

		Fixed LICENSE[x] format

		Added Portuguese and French mirrors

2003-01-21  Arwed v. Merkatz <v.merkatz@gmx.net>

		updated to 1.14.0
		added DEPENDS file (why did this disappear again?)
		added CONFIGURE file to ask which client to build
		(note: xaw3d client segfaults, so i left it out)
		changed the long description
		(there's now three X clients instead of two)
