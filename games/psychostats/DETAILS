PsychoStats is a statistics generator for the game Half-Life.

It will work with any Half-Life MOD that uses the standard log file format as of Half-Life v1.1.0.6. However, it will only give basic player stats and will not show team statistics and certain map based statistics unless the MOD is supported fully by PsychoStats. Also the default themes that come with PsychoStats are specifically designed for Counter-Strike, Day of Defeat or Firearms.
