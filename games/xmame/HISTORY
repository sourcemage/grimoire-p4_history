		New version: 0.60.1 (thanks Eric Womack
		<eric@lasvegasdata.com>), which fixes bug #500.

		Removed USEGCC2. This also means that I modified BUILD so that
		this  spell compiles at -O2 at most, since -O3 (speedy) doesn't
		work anymore (see 2002-08-02 07:21 comment for bug #500 for
		more details).
