Openglad is an SDL port of an old DOS game called Gladiator, which was developed by FSGames in the mid 90's. FSGames donated the original source (made for DOS, of course) under the GPL when one of them found our earlier project (now abandoned in favor of this one) to make a full Gladiator clone.

Gladiator is a top-down gauntlet-style RPG. In it, you hire team mates, go on missions, and improve your team with the spoils you reap. It can be played by up to 4 players (using split-screen), and comes with a scenario editor.
