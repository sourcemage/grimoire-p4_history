2002-05-02  Jerome Zago <jerome.zago@insalien.org>
 
		New version: 0.9.0

		Added workaround for the compilation to succeed
		(LIBS='-ltcl8.3 -ltk8.3').

		Man pages are now installed in /usr/share/man (FHS compliance).

		Added POST_BUILD to avoid the unnecessary 'gather_docs' step.

		Removed dependency on xfree86 for consistency (thanks Julian v.
		Bock <julian@openit.de>).
