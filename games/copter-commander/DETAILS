cat << EOF
A unique blend of arcade action and real time strategy, Copter
Commander is fun for novices but surprisingly deep. It supports one
to four players via Internet play and is based on the game design of
Rescue Raiders/Armor Alley.

Sound probably will not work in this game, even if you have esd running.
