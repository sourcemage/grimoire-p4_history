cat << EOF
XRally is a clone of the Rally X arcade game. In Rally X, you control 
a blue car which has to run through a maze-like level collecting
flags and avoiding colliding with enemy (red) cars. In order to
protect itself, the blue car can discharge clouds of smoke which stun 
the enemy cars for a while. The enemy cars can also crash into each
other, what gives you some extra time. One of the main features of
XRally is that it is fully customizable. You can create custom
tilesets and levels and load them at run time, changing the entire
look of the game. (You could, for instance, create a water tileset,
using boats instead of cars.)
