When you are ready to play, copy /usr/share/exult.cfg to ~/.exult.cfg.
Make appropriate modifications and install the gamedata files and enjoy.
Note:  You may also have to start esd, enlightenment sound daemon, in
order to get sound and music.  And if you don't own Ultima 7, then exult
will be of no use to you.
