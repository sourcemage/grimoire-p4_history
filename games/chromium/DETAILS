t  h  e    s  t  o  r  y 
You are captain of the cargo ship Chromium B.S.U., responsible for delivering supplies to our troops 
on the front line. Your ship has a small fleet of robotic fighters which you control from the relative 
safety of the Chromium vessel. 
y  o  u  r    m  i  s  s  i  o  n 
Do not let ANY enemy ships get past your fighters! Each enemy ship that makes it past the bottom of 
the screen will attack the Chromium, and you lose a fighter.Use your fighters as weapons! Crash into 
enemies to destroy them before they can get past you.Strategic suicide is a powerful tactic! When the 
Chromium launches a new fighter, it releases a high energy burst which destroys all enemies in range.
Self-destruct to preserve your ammunition! A double-right-click will cause your current fighter to 
self-destruct. Before the ship blows up, it ejects its ammunition so that the next fighter can pick it 
up.
