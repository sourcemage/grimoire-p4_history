           SHORT="More themes for xpenguins (e.g. Winnieh the Pooh"
cat << EOF
xpenguins_themes supplies even more themes vor the xpenguins package.
New are: The Simpsons, Sonic the Hedgehog, Lemmings and Winnie the Pooh.

Please be aware that according to the author the license/copyright
situation is unclear.

Naturally, installing this package doesn't make much sense unless you 
have xpenguins installed.
