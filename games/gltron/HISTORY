		Update for ${INSTALL_ROOT}

2003-01-31  Eric Sandall <eric@sandall.us>

		Fixed Bug #2443

		Also now copies scripts...don't know how this was missed
		as the game won't run without them...and another show-
		stopper is that --datadir wasn't set, so the binary
		was looking in the wrong spot for the data...

2003-01-26  Eric Sandall <eric@sandall.us>

		Updated to 0.62  (Bug #2383, thanks to Snakebyte)

		Changed data dir to /usr/lib/games

2002-09-03  Arwed v. Merkatz <v.merkatz@gmx.net>

		added MD5 and LICENSE fields

		changed MAINTAINER

2002-05-02  Jerome Zago <jerome.zago@insalien.org>

		Changed SOURCE_URL[0] since prdownloads.sourceforge.net was
		too slow.
