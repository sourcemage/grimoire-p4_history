		Update for ${INSTALL_ROOT}

2003-05-05  hgg <hgreig@bigpond.net.au>

		Updated to 1.7.0


2003-01-26  Eric Sandall <eric@sandall.us>

		Updated to 1.6.1  (Bug #2381, thanks to Snakebyte)

		Modifed BUILD to install binary into /usr/bin and
		data into /usr/share/games, again, the binary cannot
		go into /usr/games as I get the following error
		when I try with '--bindir=${INSTALL_ROOT}/usr/games'
		(same as Maelstrom):
		-bash: /usr/bin/cuyo: No such file or directory
