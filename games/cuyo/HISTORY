2003-01-26  Eric Sandall <eric@sandall.us>

		Updated to 1.6.1  (Bug #2381, thanks to Snakebyte)

		Modifed BUILD to install binary into /usr/bin and
		data into /usr/lib/games, again, the binary cannot
		go into /usr/games as I get the following error
		when I try with '--bindir=/usr/games'
		(same as Maelstrom):
		-bash: /usr/bin/cuyo: No such file or directory

2002-08-28  Gareth Clay <g.clay@warwick.ac.uk>

		Changed maintainer
