cat << EOF
cuyo is a Tetris-like game.  You have to try to put balls of
the same color together. (You don't need to form rows or
columns.  Any shape will do.) When enough of balls of the
same color are connected, they explode. (What is enough
depends on the level).  This game will waste many work hours
so be careful!
