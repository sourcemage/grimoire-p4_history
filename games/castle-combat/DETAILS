cat << EOF
It's a clone of the old DOS game Rampart. Up to four players (or more in
future versions) build castle walls, place cannons inside these walls,
and shoot at the walls of their enemy(s). If a player can't build a
complete wall around one of his castles, he loses. The last surviving
player wins.
