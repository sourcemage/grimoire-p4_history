cat << EOF
Way before Lara Croft, back in the 1980's and early 1990's, Rick Dangerous was
the Indiana Jones of computer games, running away from rolling rocks, avoiding
traps, from South America to a futuristic missile base via Egypt and the
Schwarzendumpf castle.

xrick is a clone of Rick Dangerous. Written entirely in C, it relies on the
Simple DirectMedia Layer library and has been ported to Linux (its primary
target), Windows, BeOs, Amiga, ... download and install the game, learn how to
play, and enjoy!

CAUTION!

I have written the xrick code. However, graphics and maps and sounds are by the authors of the original Rick Dangerous game, and "Rick Dangerous" remains a trademark of its owner(s) -- maybe Core Design (who wrote the game) or FireBird (who published it). I have not been successful at contacting Core Design.

This makes it a bit difficult to formally release the whole code, including data for graphics and maps and sounds, under the terms of licences such as the GNU General Public License. So the code is released in the spirit of the GNU GPL. Whatever that means.
