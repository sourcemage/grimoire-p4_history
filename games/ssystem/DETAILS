Ssystem is an OpenGL Solar System simulator. It will let you visit the
Sun, the nine planets and a few major satellites (catalog based
background stars are also supported) with four different camera modes.
Although it's not 100% accurate, planets' positions in a given date are
within a range of the real positions.
