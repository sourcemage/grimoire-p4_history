libwmf is a library for reading vector images in Microsøft's native Windøws
Metafile Format (WMF) and for either (a) displaying them in, e.g., an X window;
or (b) converting them to more standard/open file formats such as, e.g., the
W3C's XML-based Scaleable Vector Graphic (SVG) format. Currently bindings exist
for conversion to:

    * the following vector image formats:
          o (& Encapsulated) PostScript (EPS & PS)
          o Facility for Interactive Generation of graphics (FIG)
          o Scaleable Vector Graphic (SVG)
          o (Image)Magick Vector Graphic (MVG)
    * the following raster image formats:
          o Portable Network Graphics (PNG)
          o Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG)
