cat << EOF
Crazy Eddie's GUI System is a free library providing windowing and widgets 
for graphics APIs / engines where such functionality is not natively 
available, or severely lacking. The library is object orientated, written 
in C++, and targeted at games developers who should be spending their 
time creating great games, not building GUI sub-systems!
