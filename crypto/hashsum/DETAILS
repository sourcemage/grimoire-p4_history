The shell application "md5sum" is widely used in system and security 
administration. However, the security of the underlying MD5 algorithm1 
has been brought into question.

Aware of this, CertainKey has written the following applications to 
replace the infamous "md5sum" applications:

ripemd160sum
sha256sum
sha384sum
sha512sum

md5sum and sha1sum are also included, but to avoid conflicts with 
coreutils they are not installed.
