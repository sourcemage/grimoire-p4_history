OpenSSL
The OpenSSL Project is a collaborative effort to develop a robust,
commercial-grade, full-featured, and Open Source toolkit implementing
the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL v2/v3) and Transport Layer Security (TLS
v1) protocols as well as a full-strength general purpose cryptography
library. The project is managed by a worldwide community of volunteers
that use the Internet to communicate, plan, and develop the OpenSSL
toolkit and its related documentation.
OpenSSL is based on the excellent SSLeay library developed by Eric A.
Young and Tim J. Hudson. The OpenSSL toolkit is licensed under an
Apache-style licence, which basically means that you are free to get and
use it for commercial and non-commercial purposes subject to some simple
license conditions.
