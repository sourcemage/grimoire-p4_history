cat << EOF
Gpasman is a password manager. People working with the internet have to remember lots of passwords. Saving them in a textfile is not a secure idea. Gpasman is a GTK solution to this problem since it saves the password information encrypted, so now you have to remember only one password instead of ten (or more).
