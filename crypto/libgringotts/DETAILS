cat << EOF
libGringotts is a small, easy-to-use, thread-safe C library originally developed for Gringotts. Its purpose is to encapsulate data in an encrypted and compressed file. It uses strong cryptographic algorithms (RIJNDAEL 128/256, SERPENT, TWOFISH, CAST256, SAFER+, LOKI97, and 3DES for encryption, and SHA1 and RIPEMD-160 for hashing) to ensure the data are as safe as possible, and allow the user to have the complete control over all the encryption, hashing, and compression algorithms used in the process. It also provides functions for encrypting temporary files and to securely manage memory. It is based upon libmcrypt and mhash, and supports pkgconfig.
