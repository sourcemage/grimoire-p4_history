OutGuess is a universal steganographic tool that allows the insertion
of hidden information into the redundant bits of data sources.  
The nature of the data source is irrelevant to the core of OutGuess.
The program relies on data specific handlers that will extract
redundant bits and write them back after modification.  In this version
the PNM and JPEG image formats are supported.
