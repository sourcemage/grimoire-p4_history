cat << EOF
Gringotts is a small utility that allows you to jot down sensitive data 
(passwords, credit card numbers, PINs, etc.) in an easy-to-read, 
easy-to-access, and most of all very secure form. Gringotts makes use of 
the MCrypt and MHash libraries for encryption, and uses GTK+ 2 for the 
user interface. It lets the user choose from among eight strong 
encryption algorithms (RIJNDAEL-128, RIJNDAEL-256, SERPENT, TWOFISH, 
CAST-256, SAFER+, LOKI97, 3DES), two hashing algorithms (SHA1, 
RIPEMD 160) and two compression techniques (ZLib and BZip2) with four 
compression ratios. Moreover, it allows the user to use any file as a 
password, as an alternative to the usual text string, giving additional 
choices.
