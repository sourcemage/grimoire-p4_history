cat << EOF
The keychain bash script makes handling RSA and DSA keys both convenient and 
secure. It acts as a front-end to ssh-agent, allowing you to easily have one 
long-running ssh-agent process per system, rather than per login session. This 
dramatically reduces the number of times you need to enter your passphrase 
from once per new login session to once every time your local machine is 
rebooted.
