cat << EOF
ccrypt is a utility for encrypting and decrypting files 
and streams. It was designed as a replacement for the 
standard unix crypt utility, which is notorious for using 
a very weak encryption algorithm. ccrypt is based on the 
Rijndael cipher, which is the U.S. government's chosen 
candidate for the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). This 
cipher is believed to provide very strong security.
