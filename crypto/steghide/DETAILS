Steghide is a steganography program which embeds a secret message 
in a cover file by replacing some of the least significant bits 
of the cover file with bits of the secret message. After that, 
the secret message is imperceptible and can only be extracted with 
the correct passphrase. To increase invisibility the hidden bits 
are encrypted (using the blowfish encryption algorithm) and 
pseudo-randomly spread through the stego file. To verify the integrity 
of the embedded message during extraction, a crc32 checksum is 
embedded with the message. 

Steghide is able to embed data in JPEG, BMP, WAV, and AU files.
