cat << EOF
cpm is a small console tool to manage passwords and store them public key
encrypted in a file - even for more than one person. The encryption is handled
via GnuPG so you can access the programs data via gpg as well, in case you want
to have a look inside. The data is stored as XML so it's even possible to reuse
the data for some other purpose. The software uses CDK (ncurses) to handle the
user interface, libxml2 to store the information and the library GpgMe to
encrypt and decrypt the data securely.
