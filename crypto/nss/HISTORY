		Start working on this spell. 
		It now actually unpacks and builds...
		It doesn't install though have to manually cp files even after make install is run
		Can only run 1 make job though
		We have to turn off debugging though (done)
		Oh and i have dispelled Firebird to make sure it is truly independent of mozilla
