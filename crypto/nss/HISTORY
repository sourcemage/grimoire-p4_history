	*  New spell for NSS/NSPR
	Left the old history so anyone working on it knows what is what

2003-09-19 hgg <hgreig@bigpond.net.au>
	* Start working on this spell. 
	It now actually unpacks and builds...
	It doesn't install though have to manually cp files even after make install is run
	Can only run 1 make job though
	We have to turn off debugging though (done)
	Oh and i have dispelled Firebird to make sure it is truly independent of mozilla
