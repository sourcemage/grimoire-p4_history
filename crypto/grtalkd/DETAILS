Part of grsecurity utils.
grtalkd is meant to be a secure replacement for talk(1). It features
a rather small codebase...runs as a single daemon, has connection
limiting, a global configuration file, blowfish encryption, both
a client and a server, an irc-like interface, online user listing
capabilities, private message capabilities, and very secure code
(only one strcat() which is bound limited, no strcpy()s..no
sprintf()'s...).
