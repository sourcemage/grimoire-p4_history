cat << EOF
ssh-installkeys is a script that tries to export ssh public keys to a specified site. It will walk you through generating key pairs if it doesn't find any to export. It handles all the fiddly details like making sure local and remote permissions are correct, and tells you what it's doing if it has to change anything.
