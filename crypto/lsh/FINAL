message "${MESSAGE_COLOR}
Several of the lsh programs requires a good pseudorandomness generator 
for secure operation. The first thing you need to do is to create a seed file 
for the generator.  To create a personal seed file, 
stored as ~/.lsh/yarrow-seed-file, run

lsh-make-seed

To create a seed file for use by lshd, run

lsh-make-seed --server

as root. The seed file is stored as /var/spool/lsh/yarrow-seed-file. 


To run lshd, you must first create a hostkey, 
usually stored in /etc/lsh_host_key. To do this, run

lsh-keygen --server | lsh-writekey --server

This will also create a file /etc/lsh_host_key.pub, 
containing the corresponding public key.
