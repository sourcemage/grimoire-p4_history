mcrypt is a program for encrypting files or streams. It is intended
to be a replacement for the old UNIX crypt. It uses well-known and
well-tested algorithms like DES, BLOWFISH, TWOFISH, ARCFOUR,
CAST-128, and more in several modes (CBC, CFB, etc.). It also has a
compatibility mode with the old UNIX crypt and Solaris des.
