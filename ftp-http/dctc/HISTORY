		Updated version to 0.78.0:
		* In this release, the BerkeleyDB detection was improved. The transfer
 		  key of broken clients can now be accepted. When a transfer with an
 		  user ends, other waiting transfers with him are now woken up. Minor
 		  bugs were fixed in download and search. It is now possible to link
 		  DCTCs of different computers to allow them to share the user IP
 		  address database (UADDR) and to perform searchs on hub where you are
 		  not directly connected to. With the GUI, users can now be flagged from
 		  GDL list, the seen hub list is saved faster on leaving, each GDL has a
 		  time to complete its task, and the user share list is displayed as a
 		  tree and is now buffered to improve display speed.

		Updated version to 0.77.0:
		* Support for Berkeley Database 4.0, ability to limit the download
		  bandwidth and GDL gathering speed, a fix for a GUI bug preventing new
		  users from starting, ability to attach all unused GDLs to the client
		  in one click, and running clients can be terminated (or killed)
		  without being connected to.

		Updated version to 0.76.0:
		* Dutch translation of the GDL and BerkeleyDB 
		  documentations added by MyckelHabets.
		* Fix a severe security bug in the function 
		  handling download. Due to a missing character
		  in the C code, it is possible to download any 
		  file, shared or not as long as you know its name.
		  Problem notified by Morra.
		* When the client was disconnected from the hub, the 
		  previous version resets the number of GDL of the global
 		  status file. The problem has been fixed.
		* new commands added: /HIDE_KICK, /SHOW_KICK. Enable/disable 
		  hub-security global chat kick message deletion.To limit
		  pollution of global chat, I suggest you discard these 
		  annoying messages.
		* An UI can now send DCTC commands in client udp socket 
		  used by DCTC link.
		* minor error message fixed in berkeley database initialization. 
		  DCTC should no more crash when database creation fails.

		Updated verson to 0.75.0: 
		This version now avoids periodic resend of 
		unchanged MyINFO messages. Remote users can
		be "flagged" in order to ignore one or more events
		generated by them, and a new command was added 
		in the transfer protocol.
