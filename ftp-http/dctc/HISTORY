		Updated version to 0.76.0:
		* Dutch translation of the GDL and BerkeleyDB 
		  documentations added by MyckelHabets.
		* Fix a severe security bug in the function 
		  handling download. Due to a missing character
		  in the C code, it is possible to download any 
		  file, shared or not as long as you know its name.
		  Problem notified by Morra.
		* When the client was disconnected from the hub, the 
		  previous version resets the number of GDL of the global
 		  status file. The problem has been fixed.
		* new commands added: /HIDE_KICK, /SHOW_KICK. Enable/disable 
		  hub-security global chat kick message deletion.To limit
		  pollution of global chat, I suggest you discard these 
		  annoying messages.
		* An UI can now send DCTC commands in client udp socket 
		  used by DCTC link.
		* minor error message fixed in berkeley database initialization. 
		  DCTC should no more crash when database creation fails.
