Galeon is a GNOME Web browser based on Gecko (the Mozilla rendering
engine). It is fast, has a light interface, and is fully
standards-compliant.

Changelog: 1.2.0: 
           	This release requires Mozilla 0.9.9. It features favicon speedups, a
   		better crash recovery dialog, and fixed memory leaks. It also has new
		smart bookmarks and "Properties" and "Page Info" windows. Favicons are
		now shown in tabs. Changes in the preferences are now automatically
		applied. There is a new bookmarks removal confirmation dialog, session
		autosave improvements, and mouse gesture support. A "Copy email
		address" context menu item has been added, as well as a native
		JavaScript console, and new preference window icons. Also, a lot of
		other improvements and bugfixes have been made.
