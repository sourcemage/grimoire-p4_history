           SHORT="rsync is a replacement for rcp."
cat << EOF
rsync is a replacement for rcp (and scp) that has many more features.
It uses the "rsync algorithm" which provides a very fast method for
remote files into sync. It does this by sending just the differences in
the files across the link, without requiring that both sets of files are
present at one of the ends of the link beforehand.

Changelog:
20020313 - 2.5.4: 
           Additional fix for zlib double-free bug. Merge in changes 
           from zlib 1.1.3 to zlib 1.1.4.  Note that rsync still uses
           a custom version of zlib; you can not just link against
           a system library.  See zlib/README.rsync
           Additional test cases for --compress.
           To use 2.4.8 change the SOURCE to:
           SOURCE_URL[0]=http://rsync.samba.org/ftp/rsync/old-versions/$SOURCE
           SOURCE_URL[1]=ftp://rsync.samba.org/pub/rsync/old-versions/$SOURCE
