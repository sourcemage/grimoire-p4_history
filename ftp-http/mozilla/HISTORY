		Commented the /etc/mozilla references from BUILD. This means
		the spell ignores any previous configuration that existed
 		in /etc/mozilla, however, since this configuration is from 
		some reason deleted anyway during the cast, it does not 
		matter for now and it's a bad fix (but still a fix) for a 
		broken spell
