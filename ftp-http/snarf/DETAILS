snarf is a [s]imple, [n]on-interactive, [a]ll-purpose [r]esource
[f]etcher.  It can transfer files through http, gopher, finger, and ftp
protocols without user interaction.  Features ftp and http resumes on
disrupted file transfers, alternate username/password combinations, and
can follow http redirects.  Snazzy!
