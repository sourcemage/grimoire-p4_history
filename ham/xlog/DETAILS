Xlog will display a log with the most recent contacts added to the top.  You
can add, delete and edit log entries.  The log is saved into a text file.
When clicking on the log column called "Call", you can sort the log either
ascending, descending or by entry.  Xlog is able to do DXCC lookups and will
display country information, CQ and ITU zone, location in latitude and
longitude and distance and heading in kilometers or miles, both for short and
long path.
