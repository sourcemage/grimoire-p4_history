cat << EOF
Xcall is a packet-radio program for X which supports the AX.25, NET/ROM
and Rose protocols. It is written with help of the GTK library. Connection
setup is handled through a dialog with a settable timeout value. Support
for DX clusters is included by colorization of DX spots. A session can be
saved into a file, in case you like to download 7plus messages from a BBS.
