cat << EOF
SWISH++ is a Unix-based file indexing and searching engine (typically
used to index and search files on web sites). It was based on SWISH-E
although SWISH++ is a complete rewrite. SWISH++ was developed to
circumvent my difficulties with using the SWISH-E package.
Features include lightning-fast indexing, handles large collections
of files, tools included to index non-text files such as Microsoft
Office documents, near instantaneous searches, and more...
