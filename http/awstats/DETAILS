cat << EOF
AWStats is a short for Advanced Web Statistics. It's a free
tool that generates advanced web server access statistics
graphically. This web server log analyzer works as a CGI or
from command line and shows you all possible information
your log contains, in few graphical web pages. It uses a
partial information file to be able to process large log
files, often and quickly. It can analyze log files from IIS
(W3C log format), Apache log files (NCSA combined/XLF/ELF
log format or common/CLF log format), WebStar and some
other web, proxy or WAP servers (and even some FTP
servers).
