	* PREPARE: Missing update and md5sum

2004-07-11 Jose Bernardo Silva <jbernardo@sourcemage.org>
	* PREPARE,DETAILS: updated to 0.9.2
	* BUILD: --enable-single-profile added to the configure options,
	  so that make install won't fail
	* INSTALL: changed so it will install in /usr/lib/mozilla
	  (the link was being created between mozila-xx and mozila,
	  not firefox-xx and mozilla)

2004-07-04 Sergey Lipnevich <sergey@sourcemage.org>
	* BUILD, INSTALL: use API 2.

2004-07-01 Eric Sandall <eric@sandall.us>

2004-06-29 Eric Sandall <eric@sandall.us>
	* DETAILS: Updated to 0.9.1
	* PREPARE: Updated to 0.9.1
	Changed SOURCE_URLs
	SOURCE now uses $SPELL-$VERSION-source.tar.bz2
	* WIP: Compiles, but doesn't run
	* 0.9.1 (at least) needs freetype > 2.1.5 (2.1.9 worked fine here)

2004-06-28 Unet <audio@sourcemage.org>
	* BUILD: Added --enable-single-profile :p Corrected freetype.patch
	* WIP: Removed, should work now

2004-06-24 Jose Bernardo Silva <jbernardo@sourcemage.org>
	* BUILD: Close, but no cigar. Since "make install" fails, I tried a
	  "cp", but that also fails...

2004-06-24 Jose Bernardo Silva <jbernardo@sourcemage.org>
	* PREPARE: REALLY update to 0.9.0

	  else which may need the mozilla libs as such) by adding
	  /usr/lib/mozilla to /etc/ld.so.conf

	  (damn I had this lying around for days)

2003-10-28 Eric Sandall <eric@sandall.us>
	* PROVIDES: Uppercase provides

2003-10-21 hgg <hgreig@bigpond.net.au>
	* BUILD,PROVIDES: remove /root/.mozconfig if found, 
	  manually copy nss headers so this spell can also provide MOZILLA-NSS for gaim
	* PREPARE: touch $SOURCE_CACHE/$SOURCE if you already have a cvs bundle 
	  so you don't have to download 37MB of new sources

2003-10-18 Eric Sandall <eric@sandall.us>
	* DETAILS, PREPARE: Updated to 0.7

	  This spell uses gtk+2 /xft and caches the cvs updates and 
	  doesn't install that annoying /root/.mozconfig file!
	* a new version of an old spell!
	  (Merged other peoples work)
