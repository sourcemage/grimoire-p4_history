	* firefox-init.patch: This is a diff of what my /usr/lib/firefox-1.0
	  tree looked like before and after running firefox as root, so it should
	  be all we need.
	* firefox-init-0.9.tar.bz2: Removed.
	* INSTALL: Apply firefox-init.patch to MOZILLA_HOME.
	  I meant for /usr/lib/firefox to point to /usr/lib/firefox-$VERSION, so
	  that's now fixed.
	  Make MOZILLA_HOME, MOZILLA_VERSION, and FIREFOX_HOME local.
	  Set MOZILLA_VERSION to $VERSION.
	  Use FIREFOX_HOME instead of hard-coding /usr/lib/firefox.

	* Prefixed SVG with FIREFOX_
	  Renamed FOO to FIREFOX_TARBALL and HEADCODE to FIREFOX_CVS

	  FIREFOX_SOURCE when they're defined
	  SOURCE_URL now uses $VERSION
	  Updated MD5 for 1.0
	* PREPARE: SOURCE is now in subdirectory source/
	  Add FIREFOX_VERSION and FIREFOX_SOURCE as persistent and use in place of
	  VERSION and SOURCE
	  Moved SOURCE_URLs and MD5 to DETAILS, left SOURCE definition as it's used
	* BUILD: Made MOZILLA_HOME, MOZ_PHOENIX, and MOZ_INTERNAL_LIBART_LGPL local
	  Moved patching from BUILD to PRE_BUILD
	  Cleaned up formatting
	  FIREFOX_SVG uses config_query answer
	  Export MOZ_INTERNAL_LIBART_LGPL, MOZ_PHOENIX, CFLAGS, or CXXFLAGS (fails
	  if we don't export)
	* PRE_BUILD: Cleaned up formatting
	  Made FIREFOX_TARBALL local
	  FIREFOX_CVS uses config_query answer
	  Only the freetype.patch applies to 1.0 and now uses -p1
	* DEPENDS: Use if/else for checking $FIREFOX_GTK
	  Use --enable-xft instead of --disable-xft as that seems to work
	* freetype.patch: Updated to 1.0
