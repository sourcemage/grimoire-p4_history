2004-12-16 Eric Sandall <eric@sandall.us>
	* INSTALL: Thanks to johnny17, we need to create these directories before
	  doing Wolfgang's fix of `make install` before the symlinks, otherwise
	  `make install` creates both firefox and firefox-$VERSION, which we then
	  can't symlink to the other and then firefox installs part in firefox and
	  the rest to firefox-$VERSION, which makes libmozjs.so not found. :)

	* firefox-init.patch: This is a diff of what my /usr/lib/firefox-1.0

	  should be all we need.
	* firefox-init-0.9.tar.bz2: Removed.
	* INSTALL: Apply firefox-init.patch to MOZILLA_HOME.
	  I meant for /usr/lib/firefox to point to /usr/lib/firefox-$VERSION, so

	  Cleaned up formatting
	  FIREFOX_SVG uses config_query answer
	  Export MOZ_INTERNAL_LIBART_LGPL, MOZ_PHOENIX, CFLAGS, or CXXFLAGS
	  (fails if we don't export)
	* PRE_BUILD: Cleaned up formatting
	  Made FIREFOX_TARBALL local
	  FIREFOX_CVS uses config_query answer
	  Only the freetype.patch applies to 1.0 and now uses -p1

	  Use --enable-xft instead of --disable-xft as that seems to work
