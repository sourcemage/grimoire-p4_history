		bug fixes to an array bounds bug in lib/rfc1035.c

2001-12-14  Kyle Sallee

		modified BUILD so that /etc/ppp/resolv.conf is used instead of 
		/etc/resolv.conf if ppp is installed, otherwise squid crashes if
		/etc/resolv.conf is a symbolic link.

		modified so that squid can be started on boot, only if ppp is 
		not installed.  Even with -D squid will crash if started on a 
		non Internet connected box.

		modified squid.sh.  simplified it to work with SGL.
