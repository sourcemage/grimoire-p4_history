	* HISTORY: Added

2001-12-14 Kyle Sallee <anonymous@sourcemage.org>
	* BUILD: modified so that /etc/ppp/resolv.conf is used instead of 
	  /etc/resolv.conf if ppp is installed, otherwise squid crashes if
	  /etc/resolv.conf is a symbolic link.
	* modified so that squid can be started on boot, only if ppp is 
	  not installed. Even with -D squid will crash if started on a 
	  non Internet connected box.
	* squid.sh: simplified it to work with SGL.
