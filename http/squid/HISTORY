		The patch for STABLE5 was insufficently tested and 
		introduced a bug that causes frequent assertions
		when handling DNS PTR answers.

2002-03-18  Eric Schabell <eric@schabell.com>

		Squid version update 2.4-STABLE5 provides
		bug fixes to an array bounds bug in lib/rfc1035.c
		which allowed a malicious DNS server to send bogus
		replies and thus currupt the memory heap.

2002-03-13  Eric Schabell <eric@schabell.com>

		Added this History file.

		modified BUILD so that /etc/ppp/resolv.conf is used instead of 
		/etc/resolv.conf if ppp is installed, otherwise squid crashes if
		/etc/resolv.conf is a symbolic link.

		modified so that squid can be started on boot, only if ppp is 
		not installed.  Even with -D squid will crash if started on a 
		non Internet connected box.

		modified squid.sh.  simplified it to work with SGL.
