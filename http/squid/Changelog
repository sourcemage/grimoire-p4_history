modified BUILD so that /etc/ppp/resolv.conf is used instead of 
/etc/resolv.conf if ppp is installed, otherwise squid crashes if
/etc/resolv.conf is a symbolic link.

modified so that squid can be started on boot, only if ppp is 
not installed.  Even with -D squid will crash if started on a 
non Internet connected box.

modified squid.sh.  simplified it to work with SGL.
