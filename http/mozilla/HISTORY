		Made PSM (and hence Enigmail) to compile and function.

		dependencies, no questions asked in CONFIGURE.

		copied dezmond's fix incorrectly...
		flame me not him! ;)

2002-04-23  The Well-Beloved Bard <dezmond@bardicgrove.org>

		Version upgrade 1.0rc1:
		Mozilla has released a new version (1.0rc1), and broken the spell in 
		doing so. The directory and filename represent the version differently.

2002-04-11  Yoav Avitzour <avitzour@princeton.edu>

		Commented the /etc/mozilla references from BUILD. This means
		the spell ignores any previous configuration that existed
 		in /etc/mozilla, however, since this configuration is from 
		some reason deleted anyway during the cast, it does not 
		matter for now and it's a bad fix (but still a fix) for a 
		broken spell 

2002-04-08  Jon Svendsen <jon-sven@frisurf.no>

		* Install NSS headers
