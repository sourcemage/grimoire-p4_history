	  doing so. The directory and filename represent the version differently.

	  the spell ignores any previous configuration that existed
	  in /etc/mozilla, however, since this configuration is from 
	  some reason deleted anyway during the cast, it does not 
	  matter for now and it's a bad fix (but still a fix) for a 
	  broken spell
