2002-04-23  The Well-Beloved Bard <dezmond@bardicgrove.org>

		Version upgrade 1.0rc1:

		doing so. The directory and filename represent the version differently.

2002-04-11  Yoav Avitzour <avitzour@princeton.edu>

		Commented the /etc/mozilla references from BUILD. This means
		the spell ignores any previous configuration that existed
 		in /etc/mozilla, however, since this configuration is from 
		some reason deleted anyway during the cast, it does not 
		matter for now and it's a bad fix (but still a fix) for a 
		broken spell
