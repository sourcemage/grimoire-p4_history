Mozilla is a Web browser that is being developed by the Free Software
Community with the cooperation and support of Netscape. Initially,
its development was based on an early version of Netscape Communicator 5.0.
But most of it was disposed of halfway, and the current Mozilla is
a completely new software based on the "NGLayout" layout engine 
developed for Netscape Communicator 6. "Netscape 6" (the Web browser 
from Netscape) and "Beonex Communicator" are based on Mozilla. Many 
other projects use/embed Mozilla's rendering engine.

Enigmail is a "plugin" for Mozilla/Netscape7 Mail which allows users to
access the authentication and encryption features provided by the popular
GPG and PGP software.
