cat << EOF
thttpd is a simple, small, portable, fast, and secure HTTP server.

Simple:
    It handles only the minimum necessary to implement HTTP/1.1. Well, 
    maybe a little more than the minimum. 
Small:
    See the comparison chart. It also has a very small run-time size, 
    since it does not fork and is very careful about memory allocation. 
Portable:
    It compiles cleanly on most any Unix-like OS, specifically 
    including FreeBSD, SunOS 4, Solaris 2, BSD/OS, Linux, OSF. 
Fast:
    In typical use it's about as fast as the best full-featured servers 
    (Apache, NCSA, Netscape). Under extreme load it's much faster. 
Secure:
    It goes to great lengths to protect the web server machine against 
    attacks and breakins from other sites. 

It also has one extremely useful feature (URL-traffic-based throttling) 
that no other server currently has. Plus, it supports IPv6 out of the 
box, no patching required.
