2002-04-11 Yoav Avitzour <avitzour@princeton.edu>
	* BUILD: Commented the /etc/mozilla references. This means
	  the spell ignores any previous configuration that existed
	  in /etc/mozilla, however, since this configuration is from 
	  some reason deleted anyway during the cast, it does not 
	  matter for now and it's a bad fix (but still a fix) for a 
	  broken spell
