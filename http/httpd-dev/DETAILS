This is the development snapshot of Apache 2 HTTP server taken directly from
the CVS repository. It is also guaranteed to build all available modules, so
if there is a module that can be built but is not, please report a bug.

Apache is the world's most popular HTTP server, being quite possibly the best
around in terms of functionality, efficiency, security and speed.
