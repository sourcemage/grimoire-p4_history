	Updated mksscert.sh to generate certificates for multiple
	services, signed by the same "self-proclaimed" CA.

2002-10-08 Sergey Lipnevich <sergeyli@pisem.net>

	Rewritten mksscert.sh to generate valid certificates
	for CA (self-signed) and for the server (signed by CA).
	Upgraded to APACHE_2_0_43 with checksums.

2002-09-16 Sergey Lipnevich <sergeyli@pisem.net>

	Converted spell to use cvs:// URLs supported by sorcery.

	No need to check out httpd-ldap separately because it is now
	added to modules/experimental. Doesn't apper to generate the
	module itself now, so more changes are anticipated on LDAP
	support.

2002-08-02 Sergey Lipnevich <sergeyli@pisem.net>

	Spell created.
