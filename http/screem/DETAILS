SCREEM is a web site development environment It's purpose is to increase
productivity when constructing a site, by providing quick access to commonly
used features. While it is written for use with the GNOME desktop environment
in mind it does not specifically require you to be running it, just have the
libraries installed.
Unlike most other web site / HTML editors SCREEM does not provide a WYSIWYG
display of pages. Instead you are presented with the raw html source in its
editor window.
