Zen Cart is a php ecommerce shopping program. Built on a foundation of oscommerce GPL code it will provide an easy to set-up and run online store. Developed by people who make a living from selling online and who understand what the merchant really needs.

Zen Cart truly is the art of e-commerce; a free, user-friendly, open source shopping cart system. The software is being developed by group of like-minded shop owners, programmers, designers, and consultants that think e-commerce could be and should be done differently. Some "solutions" seem to be complicated programming exercises instead of responding to users' needs, Zen Cart puts the merchant's and shopper's requirements first. Similarly, other programs are nearly impossible to install and use without an IT degree, Zen Cart can be installed and set-up by anyone with the most basic computer skills. Others are so expensive ... not Zen Cart, it's FREE!
