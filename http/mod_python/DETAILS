cat << EOF
Mod_python is an Apache module that embeds the Python interpreter within
the server. With mod_python you can write web-based applications in Python
that will run many times faster than traditional CGI and will have access
to advanced features such as ability to retain database connections and
other data between hits and access to Apache internals.
