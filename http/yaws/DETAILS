SHORT="Yaws is a HTTP high perfomance 1.1 webserver."

cat << EOF
The main advantages of yaws compared to other Web technologies 
are performance and elegance. The performance comes from the 
underlying Erlang system and its ability to handle concurrent 
processes in an efficent way. Its elegance comes from Erlang as 
well. Web applications dont have to be written in ugly adhoc 
languages.
