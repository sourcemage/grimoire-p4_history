cat << EOF
YAFP (Yet Another Filter Proxy) is a preforking, bannerfiltering, anonymizing, 
compressing proxy written in Perl. Instead of blocking ads by simple URL 
blocking (like junkbuster) it uses patternmatching on the content, which allows 
removing popups and malicious code from websites.

The proxy was originally based upon an example proxy written by Randal L. 
Schwartz for the February edition 1999 of the webmagazine Web Techniques. 
However the newest version is rewritten nearly completely to fit my needs.

Please be sure to install recent versions of the needed modules as older ones 
can render some websites completely unusable!
