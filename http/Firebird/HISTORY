		Added MozillaFirebird -> mozilla symlink for evolution2

		And giving credit where credit is due "THANKS DEMONLORD"

		First Woops-a-daisy didn't change the mozilla links.

		This spell uses gtk+2 /xft and caches the cvs updates and 
		doesn't install that annoying /root/.mozconfig file!
		
		a new version of an old spell!
		(Merged other peoples work)
