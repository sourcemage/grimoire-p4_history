cat << EOF
Squirm is a fast & configurable redirector for the Squid
Internet Object Cache. It requires the GNU Regex Library
(now included in the Squirm source), and of course,
a working Squid.
Squirm has the following features:
* Very, very fast
* Virtually no memory usage
* It can re-read it's config files while running
  by sending it a HUP signal
* Interactive test mode for checking new configs
* Full regular expression matching and replacement
* Config files for patterns and IP addresses.
* If you mess up the config file, Squirm runs in Dodo Mode
  so your squid keeps working :-)
