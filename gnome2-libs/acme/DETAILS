cat << EOF
A small tool for your laptops. It makes the small multimedia buttons
on these things actually do something. It currently only fully supports
Apple laptops (iBooks and PowerBooks) and should work on other systems
as well.

Supported is:
- Volume keys (Mute, Volume Down, Volume Up)
- Brightness keys (kernel 2.4.18-rc2-benh minimum)
- Eject (just launches "eject")
- Power (asks to exit the current Gnome session)
- My Home (opens a file manager window in your home dir)
- Search (launches gnome-search tool)
- E-Mail (launches evolution or balsa)
- Sleep (uses apm to put to sleep)
- Screensaver (launches gnome's screensaver)
- Finance (launches gnucash)
- Help (launches yelp)
- Record (launches gnome-sound-recorder)
- WWW (launches an empty new browser)
- Calculator (launches gnome-calculator)

Eject and Power need to be pressed for a longer time to take effect.
The automatic dimming of the screen when inactive was removed, as this
functionality is available in a less broken way in XFree 4.2.
