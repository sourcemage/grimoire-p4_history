libIDL is a library licensed under the GNU LGPL for creating trees of
CORBA Interface Definition Language (IDL) files, which is a
specification for defining portable interfaces.  libIDL was
initially written for ORBit (the ORB from the GNOME project, and the 
primary means of libIDL distribution).  However, the functionality was
designed to be as reusable and portable as possible.
