The GNOME themes extras package is a collection of metathemes
for the GNOME desktop environment. This package requires that
you use a GNOME 2.2 release or newer to work properly. The
design goal of this package is to give GNOME users an extra
set of themes that are not only functional, but also eye
catching. While the main GNOME themes package tends to offer
fairly conservative themes this package tries to include
themes with a more distinct look. Another thing that separates
the GNOME themes extras themes from the themes in the
gnome-themes package is that most of the graphics in them are
vector graphics files in the SVG format. These themes are
using actual SVG files for their icons, not SVG files converted
to PNG which are seen in some other themes. Also provides the gtk-industrial-engine package
