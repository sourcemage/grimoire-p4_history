GAL are the Gnome Application Libraries"

This module contains some library functions that came from Gnumeric and
Evolution.  The idea is to reuse the code across various larger GNOME
applications that might want to use it.  The API is not frozen and might
change at any time.  Larger class renaming might happen at any point
without notice. Use this library at your own risk.

We envision some of this code being moved to Gtk+ or Gnome-Libs at
some point, but not before 2.0, and certainly we don't know which ones
yet.
