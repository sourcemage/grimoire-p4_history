cat << EOF
The package contains the libgnome-desktop library
which contains APIs that really belong in libgnome[ui] but
have not seen enough testing or development to be considered
stable. Use at your own risk.

Also contained here are documents installed as part
of the core GNOME distribution, e.g. the GPL, GNOME's
.desktop files, the gnome-about program, some manpages and
GNOME's core graphics files and icons.
