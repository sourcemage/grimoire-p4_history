PEAR MDB is a merge of the PEAR DB and
Metabase php database abstraction layers.

It provides a common API for all support
RDBMS. The main difference to most other DB
abstraction packages is that MDB goes much
further to ensure portability. Among other
things MDB features:
* An OO-style query API
* A DSN (data source name) or array format
for specifying database servers
* Datatype abstraction and on demand
datatype conversion
* Portable error codes
* Sequential and non sequential row fetching
as well as bulk fetching
* Ordered array and associative array for
the fetched rows
* Prepare/execute (bind) emulation
* Sequence emulation
* Replace emulation
* Limited Subselect emulation
* Row limit support
* Transactions support
* Large Object support
* Index/Unique support
* Module Framework to load advanced
functionality on demand
* Table information interface
* RDBMS management methods (creating,
dropping, altering)
* RDBMS independent xml based schema
definition management
* Altering of a DB from a changed xml schema
* Reverse engineering of xml schemas from an
existing DB (currently only MySQL)
* Full integration into the PEAR Framework
* Wrappers for the PEAR DB and Metabase APIs
* PHPDoc API documentation

Currently supported RDBMS:
MySQL
PostGreSQL
Oracle
Frontbase
Querysim
Interbase
Firebird
MSSQL
Other soon to follow.
