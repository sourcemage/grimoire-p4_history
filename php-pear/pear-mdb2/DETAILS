cat << EOF
PEAR MDB2 is a merge of the PEAR DB and Metabase
php database abstraction layers.
It provides a common API for all supported
RDBMS. The main difference to most
other DB abstraction packages is that MDB2 goes
much further to ensure
portability. Among other things MDB2 features:
* An OO-style query API
* A DSN (data source name) or array format for
specifying database servers
* Datatype abstraction and on demand datatype
conversion
* Various optional fetch modes to fix
portability issues
* Portable error codes
* Sequential and non sequential row fetching as
well as bulk fetching
* Ability to make buffered and unbuffered
queries
* Ordered array and associative array for the
fetched rows
* Prepare/execute (bind) emulation
* Sequence emulation
* Replace emulation
* Limited sub select emulation
* Row limit support
* Transactions support
* Large Object support
* Index/Unique Key/Primary Key support
* Autoincrement emulation
* Module framework to load advanced
functionality on demand
* Ability to read the information schema
* RDBMS management methods (creating, dropping,
altering)
* Reverse engineering schemas from an existing
DB
* SQL function call abstraction
* Full integration into the PEAR Framework
* PHPDoc API documentation
