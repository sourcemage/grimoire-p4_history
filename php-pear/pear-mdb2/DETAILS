cat << EOF
PEAR MDB2 is a merge of the PEAR DB and Metabase
php database abstraction layers.
Note that the API will be adapted to better fit
with the new php5 only PDO
before the first stable release.
It provides a common API for all supported
RDBMS. The main difference to most
other DB abstraction packages is that MDB2 goes
much further to ensure
portability. Among other things MDB2 features:
* An OO-style query API
* A DSN (data source name) or array format for
specifying database servers
* Datatype abstraction and on demand datatype
conversion
* Various optional fetch modes to fix
portability issues
* Portable error codes
* Sequential and non sequential row fetching as
well as bulk fetching
* Ability to make buffered and unbuffered
queries
* Ordered array and associative array for the
fetched rows
* Prepare/execute (bind) emulation
* Sequence emulation
* Replace emulation
* Limited sub select emulation
* Row limit support
* Transactions support
* Large Object support
* Index/Unique Key/Primary Key support
* Autoincrement emulation
* Module framework to load advanced
functionality on demand
* Ability to read the information schema
* RDBMS management methods (creating, dropping,
altering)
* Reverse engineering schemas from an existing
DB
* SQL function call abstraction
* Full integration into the PEAR Framework
* PHPDoc API documentation
