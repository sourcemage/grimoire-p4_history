           SHORT='PEAR: An implementation of Integrated Templates API'
cat << EOF
HTML_Template_Sigma implements Integrated
Templates API designed by Ulf Wendel.

Features:
* Nested blocks. Nesting is controlled by the
engine.
* Ability to include files from within template:
&lt;!-- INCLUDE --&gt;
* Automatic removal of empty blocks and unknown
variables (methods to manually tweak/override
this are also available)
* Methods for runtime addition and replacement
of blocks in templates
* Ability to insert simple function calls into
templates: func_uppercase('Hello world!') and to
define callback functions for these
* 'Compiled' templates: the engine has to parse
a template file using regular expressions to
find all the blocks and variable placeholders.
This is a very "expensive" operation and is an
overkill to do on every page request: templates
seldom change on production websites. Thus this
feature: an internal representation of the
template structure is saved into a file and this
file gets loaded instead of the source one on
subsequent requests (unless the source changes)
* PHPUnit-based tests to define correct
behaviour
* Usage examples for most of the features are
available, look in the docs/ directory
