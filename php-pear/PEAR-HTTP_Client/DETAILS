cat << EOF
The HTTP_Client class wraps around HTTP_Request
and provides a higher level interface
for performing multiple HTTP requests.

Features:
* Manages cookies and referrers between requests
* Handles HTTP redirection
* Has methods to set default headers and request
parameters
* Implements the Subject-Observer design
pattern: the base class sends
events to listeners that do the response
processing.
