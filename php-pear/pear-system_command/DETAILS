cat << EOF
System_Command is a commandline execution
interface.
Running functions from the commandline can be
risky if the proper precautions are
not taken to escape the shell arguments and
reaping the exit status properly.  This class
provides a formal interface to both, so that
you can run a system command as comfortably as
you would run a php function, with full pear
error handling as results on failure.
It is important to note that this class, unlike
other implementations, distinguishes between
output to stderr and output to stdout.  It also
reports the exit status of the command.
So in every sense of the word, it gives php
shell capabilities.
