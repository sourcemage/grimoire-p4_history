cat << EOF
Generic classes for representation and
manipulation of
dates, times and time zones without the need of
timestamps,
which is a huge limitation for php programs.
Includes time zone data,
time zone conversions and many date/time
conversions.
It does not rely on 32-bit system date stamps,
so
you can display calendars and compare dates
that date
pre 1970 and post 2038. This package also
provides a class
to convert date strings between Gregorian and
Human calendar formats.
