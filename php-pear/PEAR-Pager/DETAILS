cat << EOF
If you have data that needs paging (ie 1-10 on
page one, 11-20 on page two) this class can
help. Pass it an array of data or a number of
items and it will sort it into pages, picking up
the current page id from the url. It can also
give you back/next and page number links taking
the current url and adding the correct page id
to it.
