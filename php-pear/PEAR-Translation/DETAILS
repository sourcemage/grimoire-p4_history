Class allows storing and retrieving all the
strings on multilingual site in a database. The
class connects to any database using PEAR::DB
extension. The object should be created for
every page. While creation all the strings
connected with specific page and the strings
connected with all the pages on the site are
loaded into variable, so access to them is quite
fast and does not overload database server
connection.
