cat << EOF
DB is a database abstraction layer providing:
* an OO-style query API
* a DSN (data source name) format for specifying
database servers
* prepare/execute (bind) emulation for databases
that don't support it natively
* a result object for each query response
* portable error codes
* sequence emulation
* sequential and non-sequential row fetching as
well
as bulk fetching
* ordered array, associative array and object
formats
supported for the fetched rows
* row limit support
* transactions support
* table information interface
* DocBook and PHPDoc API documentation

DB layers itself on top of PHP's existing
database
extensions.  The currently supported extensions
are:
dbase, fbsql, interbase, informix, msql, mssql,
mysql,
oci8, odbc, pgsql, sqlite and sybase (DB style
interfaces to LDAP servers and MS ADO (using
COM) are
also avaible from a separate package).
