cat << EOF
Text_Highlighter is a package for syntax
highlighting.
It provides a base class provining all the
functionality,
and a descendent classes geneator class.
The main idea is to simplify creation of
subclasses
implementing syntax highlighting for particular
language.
Subclasses do not implement any new
functioanality,
they just provide syntax highlighting rules.
The rules sources are in XML format.
To create a highlighter for a language, there
is no need
to code a new class manually. Simply describe
the rules
in XML file and use Text_Highlighter_Generator
to create
a new class.
