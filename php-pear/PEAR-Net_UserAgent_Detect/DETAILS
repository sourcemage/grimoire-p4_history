The Net_UserAgent object does a number of tests
on an HTTP user
agent string.  The results of these tests are
available via methods of
the object.

This module is based upon the JavaScript browser
detection code
available at
http://www.mozilla.org/docs/web-developer/sniffe
r/browser_type.html.
This module had many influences from the
lib/Browser.php code in
version 1.3 of Horde.
