cat << EOF
This command is an improved implementation of
the standard makerpm command,
and contains several enhancements that make
it far more flexible. Similar
functions for other external packaging
mechanisms may be added at a later date.
Enhanced features over the original PEAR
"makerpm" command include:
- Ability to define a release on the command
line
- Allows more advanced customisation of the
generated package name
- Allows virtual Provides/Requires that
differ in format from the package name
format
- tries to intelligently distinguish between
PEAR and PECL when generating
packages
