cat << EOF
Package for communication with NNTP/Usenet
servers.
Net_NNTP handles the connection and protocol
level commands (RFC977), including many
non-standard commands (RFC2980).
Net_NNTP includes an unserfriendly API for
intermediate user, who don&#65533;t want to
work directly at the command level. However,
Net_NNTP does require some knowlege about the
NNTP protocol (RFC 977), and general knowledge
about email (RFC(2)822) and MIME (2045-2048),
since any handling of both content and headers
is left up to the user!
The protocol implementation does not parse the
actual article data, but at the command level
it splits returned data at protocol specified
boundaries where appropriate.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Release subscription and stats avalible at:
http://freshmeat.net/projects/net_nntp/
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The following branches are being maintained:
v1.0 - stable branch
----------------------------
* Roadmap:
- Backward compatible with v0.2 (not guarantied
to continue in later releases !!!).
- Implementation of every standard/base NNTP
command in RFC 977 (still a few commands
missing).
v1.3 - development branch (will become v1.4
when stable)
----------------------------
* Download:
http://pear.php.net/get/Net_NNTP-(alpha|beta|devel)
- Logging via PEAR::Log (done)
- Fully functional demo newsgroup reader
(done).
- Fully documented via PhpDocumentor (partially
done)
- And finally, no more experimental features,
sonce almost everything is finally
implemented...
- WARNING: The experimental classes
Net_NNTP_Message and Net_NNTP_Header is
considered deprecated, and will as such never
be included in a stable release!!!
v2.0 - planning /thinking
----------------------------
* Roadmap:
- PHP5 rewrite (requires Net_Socket t be
rewritten first)
- Possibly a NNTP-server, but honestly no
current plans.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This package uses a rather conservative release
cycle! Features won't go stable until they are
truly ready for use in a production
environment. Feature additions remains in alpha
testing until the API is expected to be stable,
and stays in beta testing until the code itself
is proven stable.
As in other open source projects even minor
versions is stable, and odd minor versions is
non-stable...
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WARNING!
The Net_NNTP_Protocol_Client class is
considered internal and subject to API-changes
&#65533; it is currently incomplete, but very
functional and well tested!
NOTE
Minor feature additions (including some not
mentioned in the roadmap) might be copied
downwards through branches and become part of
the latest stable branch. Non-stable branches
won&#65533;t become stable until the
requirements in the roadmap have been at least
close to fulfilled!
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Due to misunderstandings conserning the
versioning scheme of Net_NNTP the following two
branches has been abandoned (development
continues in v1.3):
v1.1 - beta quality
----------------------------
Includes a few experimental features from
v0.11, which was not included in the v1.0
release, since they are not considered fully
mature yet, and since a possible minor BC-break
would result in a Net_NNTP2.
* Download:
http://pear.php.net/get/Net_NNTP-beta
* Roadmap:
- Ability to fetch message data into
foreign/external Transfer Object objects.
- Addition of commonly implemented non-standard
commands in RFC 2980.
v1.2 - alpha quality
----------------------------
Includes the classes Net_NNTP_Message and
Net_NNTP_Header, both of which are functional
yet still considered very experimental (and
currently unmentioned), although they have been
around for quite some!
* Download:
http://pear.php.net/get/Net_NNTP-alpha
* Roadmap:
- Addition of (every) command(s) in the
possibly upcoming version 2 of NNTP (this might
trigger a major release because of a BC break)
- Possibly integrated MIME decoding and
parsing.g many commonly implemented
non-standard commands (RFC2980).
Net_NNTP includes an unserfriendly API for
intermediate user, who don't want to work
directly at the command level. However,
Net_NNTP does require some knowlege about the
