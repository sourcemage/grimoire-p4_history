Package for communicating with NNTP/Usenet
servers
-----------------------------
This package uses a rather conservative release
cycle: New features won't go beta until they are
truely ready for use in a production
environment.
-----------------------------
The following branches is being actively
maintained, each having different states:
STABLE (v1.0)
- Download: http://pear.php.net/get/Net_NNTP
- Backward compatibility with the v0.2
releases.
- Implementation of every standard/base NNTP
command.
- The Net_NNTP_Protocol_Client class is
considered internal and subject to changes,
since it's currently incomplete but very
functional and well tested.
BETA (v1.1)
- Download:
http://pear.php.net/get/Net_NNTP-beta
- Includes a few experimental features from
v0.11, which is not included in the v1.0
release, since they are not considered fully
mature yet.
- Road-map: Parsing of message data via
external classes (stripped down versions of
methods from the v1.2 API).
ALPHA (v1.2)
- Download:
http://pear.php.net/get/Net_NNTP-alpha
- Includes the classes Net_NNTP_Message and
Net_NNTP_Header (which is still considered
experimental, although they have been stable
for quite some time).
- Road-map: Own MIME implementation.
DEVEL (v1.3)
- Road-map: Possibly a NNTP-server, but
honestly no current plans.
-----------------------------
NOTE: New minor features, which are not
mentioned in the road-map, and which has been
tested in the alpha releases, might also become
part of the stable or the beta releases.
NOTE: The Protocol implementation
(Net_NNTP_Protocol_Client) is identical in
current releases (v1.0, v1.1 and v1.2). The
difference between these releases is additional
fetures in the the pulbic API (Net_NNTP_Client).
Modifications to Net_NNTP_Protocol_Client in
v1.2 is most likeley to be copied to both v1.1
and v1.0 when they have been well tested...
-----------------------------
Note:
A PHP5-only version of Net_NNTP has been under
development and functional since PHP5 beta3
(fall 2003), but due to lack of time etc. this
project is currently unpublished...
