cat << EOF
Package for communicating with NNTP/USENET
servers. Includes features like post, view,
list, authentication, overview, etc.

<hr>
Maintained versions of Net_NNTP:<ul>
<li><b>0.10.x</b> (alpha) - <i>(merges v0.3.3
and v0.9.4 into one package)</i><br>
Backward compatible drop in replacement for
v0.2.x<br>
This is going to become the v1.0 release<br>
The Net_NNTP class from v0.9.x is now called
Net_NNTP_Realtime. The backward compatibility
with v0.2.x (and v0.3.x) is only included to
allow existing projects to function. (please ;)
use the Net_NNTP_Realtime class in new
projects...
<br></li>

<li><b>0.2.x</b> (stable) - <i>(<u>no further
development</u> - only <u>critical</u> bugs will
be fixed)</i><br>
Rather outdated, but widely used.<br></li>
</ul>
<hr>
Unmaintained versions of Net_NNTP:<ul>
<li><b><s>0.1</s></b> (stable) - <i>(<u>no
further development</u> - use v0.2.x
instead)</i><br>
Rather outdated, but widely used.<br>NOT
binary-safe<br></li></ul>

<hr>
Deprecated versions of Net_NNTP:<ul>
<li><b><s>0.9.x</s></b> (alpha) - <i>(<u>no
further development</u> - use v0.10.x
instead)</i><br>
A few method names have changed, so it does not
maintain full backward compatibility with
v0.2.x<br>
A new protocol implementation has replaced the
original one, and the behavior of a few methods
has changed. Two new (experimental) classes,
Header and Message, has been added to ease the
development. (The clasic API is actually
considered beta state, but due to the two new
classes the package has to be considered alpha
state)...<br>
If backward compatibility with v0.2 is a
requirement, the new protocol implementation
from v0.9 is also avalible in v0.3 (which is
actually a modified v0.9, where some of the new
features has been left out).<br></li>


<li><b><s>0.3.x</s></b> (beta) - <i>(<u>no
further development</u> - use v0.10.x instead -
v0.10.0 includes an excat copy of the classes in
v0.3.3)</i><br>
Backward compatible drop in replacement for
v0.2.x<br>
An amputated backport of v0.9.x. It uses the new
protocol implememtation from v0.9.x, but
preserves backward compatibility with v0.2.x.
(The new alpha state code has been left out, and
the methods which has been renamed still
function as usual even though they are now only
aliases to their replacements).
This version was created to allow people who
require backward compatibility with v0.2.x to
use/test the new protocol implementation.<br>
(Not all changes in v0.9.x relate to v0.3.x, so
don't expect this backport to be updated each
time a new v0.9.x release is rolled out)<br>
(Please don't use the old method names for new
projects)<br>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<b>The new protocol implementation (v0.3 & v0.9
& v0.10) is to considered beta state.</b> The
error handling is a lot better than in v0.2, but
is still a little weak, since the error
codes/messages is not done yet (PEAR_Error
objects IS returned, but often without messages)
- most kinds of errors are caught though...
