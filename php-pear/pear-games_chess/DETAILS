cat << EOF
The logic of handling a chessboard and parsing
standard
FEN (Farnsworth-Edwards Notation) for
describing a position as well as SAN
(Standard Algebraic Notation) for describing
individual moves is handled.  This
class can be used as a backend driver for
playing chess, or for validating
and/or creating PGN files using the
File_ChessPGN package.
Although this package is alpha, it is fully
unit-tested.  The code works, but
the API is fluid, and may change dramatically
as it is put into use and better
ways are found to use it.  When the API
stabilizes, the stability will increase.
