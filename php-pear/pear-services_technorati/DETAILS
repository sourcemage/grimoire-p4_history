REST-based Technorati webservices API.
Technorati is a blog search engine that
provides a number of interfaces for interacting
with recent blog entries, such as searching for
entries that link to a certain URL, are linked
from a certain URL, or have been given certain
tags.
Services_Technorati provides an interface to
all of the query types in Technorati API
version 1.0, and supports filesystem caching of
