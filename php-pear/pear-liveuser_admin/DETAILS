LiveUser_Admin is meant to be used with the
LiveUser package.
It is composed of all the classes necessary
to administrate
data used by LiveUser.
You'll be able to add/edit/delete/get things
like:
* Rights
* Users
* Groups
* Areas
* Applications
* Subgroups
* ImpliedRights
And all other entities within LiveUser.
At the moment we support the following
storage containers:
* DB
* MDB
* MDB2
But it takes no time to write up your own
storage container,
so if you like to use native mysql functions
straight, then it's possible
to do so in under a hour!
