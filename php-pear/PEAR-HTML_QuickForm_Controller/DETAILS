The package is essentially an implementation of
a PageController pattern.
Architecture:
* Controller class that examines HTTP requests
and manages form values persistence across
requests.
* Page class (subclass of QuickForm)
representing a single page of the form.
* Business logic is contained in subclasses of
Action class.
Cool features:
* Includes several default Actions that allow
easy building of multipage forms.
* Includes usage examples for common usage cases
(single-page form, wizard, tabbed form).
