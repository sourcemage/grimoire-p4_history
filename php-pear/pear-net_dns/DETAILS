           SHORT='PEAR: Resolver library used to communicate with a DNS'
cat << EOF
A resolver library used to communicate with a
name server to perform DNS queries, zone
transfers, dynamic DNS updates, etc.  Creates
an object hierarchy from a DNS server's
response, which allows you to view all of the
information given by the DNS server.  It
bypasses the system's resolver library and
communicates directly with the server.
