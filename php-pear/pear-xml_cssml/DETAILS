The best way to describe this library is to
classify it as a template system for generating
cascading style sheets (CSS). It is ideal for
storing all of the CSS in a single location and
allowing it to be parsed as needed at runtime
(or from cache) using both general and browser
filters specified in the attribute for the style
tags. It can be driven with either the libxslt
pear extenstion (part of xmldom) or the xslt
extension (part of the sablotron libraries).

You may see an example usage of this class at
the follow url:

Users may post questions or comments about the
class at this location.

My hope is that such a system becomes the
standard for the organization of stylesheet
information in the future.
