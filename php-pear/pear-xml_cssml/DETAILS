The best way to describe this library is to
classify it as a template system for generating
cascading style sheets (CSS). It is ideal for
storing all of the CSS in a single location and
allowing it to be parsed as needed at runtime
(or from cache) using both general and browser
filters specified in the attribute for the
style tags. It can be driven with either the
libxslt pear extenstion (part of xmldom) or the
xslt extension (part of the sablotron
libraries).
My hope is that such a system becomes the
standard for the organization of stylesheet
information in the future.
