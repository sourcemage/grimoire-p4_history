cat << EOF
This is a parser to replace UBB style tags with
their html equivalents.
It does not simply do some regex calls, but is
complete stack based parse engine. This ensures
that all tags are properly nested, if not, extra
tags are added to maintain the nesting. This
parser should only produce xhtml 1.0 compliant
code. All tags are validated and so are all
their attributes. It should be easy to extend
this parser with your own tags.
