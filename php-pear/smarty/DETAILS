Smarty is a template engine for PHP. More specifically, it facilitates
a manageable way to separate application logic and content from its
presentation. This is best described in a situation where the application
programmer and the template designer play different roles, or in most
cases are not the same person. For example, let's say you are creating
a web page that is displaying a newspaper article. The article headline,
tagline, author and body are content elements, they contain no information
about how they will be presented. They are passed into Smarty by the
application, then the template designer edits the templates and uses
a combination of HTML tags and template tags to format the presentation
of these elements (HTML tables, background colors, font sizes, style
sheets, etc.) One day the programmer needs to change the way the article
content is retrieved (a change in application logic.) This change does not
affect the template designer, the content will still arrive in the
template exactly the same. Likewise, if the template designer wants to
completely redesign the templates, this requires no changes to the
application logic. Therefore, the programmer can make changes to the
application logic without the need to restructure templates, and the
template designer can make changes to templates without breaking
application logic.
