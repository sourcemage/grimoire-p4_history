cat << EOF
PHP_Parser is a source code analysis tool based
around a real Parser
generated by phpJay.  The parser uses the same
EBNF source that PHP
uses to parse itself, and it therefore as
robust as PHP itself.
This version has full support for parsing out
every re-usable element
in PHP 5 as of beta 1:
- classes
- abstract classes
- inheritance, implements
- interfaces
- methods
- exception parsing directly from source
- static variables declared
- global and superglobal ($_GET) variables
used
and declared
- variables
- constants
- functions (same information as methods)
- defines
- global variables (with help of the Tokenizer
Lexer)
- superglobal variables used in global code
- include statements
The output can be customized to return an
array, return
objects of user-specified classes, and can also
be
customized to publish each element as it is
parsed, allowing
hooks into parsing to catch information.
