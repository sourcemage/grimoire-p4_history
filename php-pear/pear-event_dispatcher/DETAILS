cat << EOF
The Event_Dispatcher acts as a notification
dispatch table.
It is used to notify other objects of
interesting things. This
information is encapsulated in
Event_Notification objects. Client
objects register themselves with the
Event_Dispatcher as observers of
specific notifications posted by other objects.
When an event occurs,
an object posts an appropriate notification to
the Event_Dispatcher.
The Event_Dispatcher dispatches a message to
each registered
observer, passing the notification as the sole
argument.
