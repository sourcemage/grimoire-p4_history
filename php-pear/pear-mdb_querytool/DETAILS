cat << EOF
This package is an OO-abstraction to the
SQL-Query language, it provides methods such
as setWhere, setOrder, setGroup, setJoin, etc.
to easily build queries.
It also provides an easy to learn interface that
interacts nicely with HTML-forms using
arrays that contain the column data, that shall
be updated/added in a DB.
This package bases on an SQL-Builder which lets
you easily build
SQL-Statements and execute them.
NB: this is just a MDB porting from the original
DB_QueryTool
written by Wolfram Kriesing and Paolo Panto
(vision:produktion, wk@visionp.de).
