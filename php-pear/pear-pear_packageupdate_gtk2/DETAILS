PEAR_PackageUpdate (PPU) is designed to allow
developers to easily include auto updating
features for other packages and PEAR
installable applications. PPU will check to see
if a new version of a package is available and
then ask the user if they would like to update
the package. PPU uses PEAR to communicate with
the channel server and to execute the update.
PPU allows the end user to take some control
over when they are notified about new releases.
The PPU Preferences allow a user to tell PPU not
to ask about certain types of releases (bug
fixes, minor releases, etc.), not to ask about
certain release states (devel, alpha, etc.),
not to ask until the next release or not to ask
again.
PEAR_PackgeUpdate_Gtk2 is a PHP-GTK 2 front
end for PPU. It is designed to be used by
PHP-GTK 2 packages and applications that want
to include auto-updating features.
