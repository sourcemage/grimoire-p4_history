cat << EOF
The class converts images, such as of the format
JPEG, PNG and GIF to a standalone SVG
representation. The image is being encoded by
the PHP native encode_base64() function. You can
use it to get back a complete SVG file, which is
based on a predefinded, easy adaptable template
file, or you can take the encoded file as a
return value, using the get() method. Due to the
encoding by base64, the SVG files will increase
approx. 30% in size compared to the conventional
image.
