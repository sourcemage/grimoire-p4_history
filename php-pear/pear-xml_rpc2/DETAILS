XML_RPC2 is a pear package providing XML_RPC
client and server services. XML-RPC is a simple
remote procedure call protocol built using HTTP
as transport and XML as encoding.
As a client library, XML_RPC2 is capable of
creating a proxy class which exposes the
methods exported by the server. As a server
library, XML_RPC2 is capable of exposing
methods from a class or object instance,
seamlessly exporting local methods as remotely
callable procedures.
