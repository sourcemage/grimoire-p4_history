This package revolutionizes the maintenance of
PEAR packages.  With a few parameters,
the entire package.xml is automatically updated
with a listing of all files in a package.
Features include
- manages the new package.xml 2.0 format in
PEAR 1.4.0
- can detect PHP and extension dependencies
using PHP_CompatInfo
- reads in an existing package.xml file, and
only changes the release/changelog
- a plugin system for retrieving files in a
directory.  Currently two plugins
exist, one for standard recursive directory
content listing, and one that
reads the CVS/Entries files and generates a
file listing based on the contents
of a checked out CVS repository
- incredibly flexible options for assigning
install roles to files/directories
- ability to ignore any file based on a * ?
wildcard-enabled string(s)
- ability to include only files that match a *
? wildcard-enabled string(s)
- ability to manage dependencies
- can output the package.xml in any directory,
and read in the package.xml
file from any directory.
- can specify a different name for the
package.xml file
PEAR_PackageFileManager is fully unit tested.
The new PEAR_PackageFileManager2 class is not.
