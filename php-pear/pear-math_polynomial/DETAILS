           SHORT='PEAR: Package to represent and manipulate polynomials'
cat << EOF
A math package to represent and manipulate
polynomials ( equations of the form ax^n +
bx^(n - 1) + ... yx + z, or, for example: 5x^3
+ 6x^2 + 4x + 2 )
The class follows the API of other packages in
the Math category, with a Polynomial class to
represent the data and a PolynomialOp class for
operations on the Polynomials. Operations
included multiplying, adding, subtracting,
dividing, finding the derivative of,
calculating tangents, calculating concavity,
etc.
