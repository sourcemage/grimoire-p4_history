cat << EOF
Class to handle mail queue managment.
Wrapper for PEAR::Mail and PEAR::DB (or
PEAR::MDB/MDB2).
It can load, save and send saved mails in
background
and also backup some mails.
The Mail_Queue class puts mails in a temporary
container,
waiting to be fed to the MTA (Mail Transport
Agent),
and sends them later (e.g. a certain amount of
mails
every few minutes) by crontab or in other way.
