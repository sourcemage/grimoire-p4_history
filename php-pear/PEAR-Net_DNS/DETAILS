           SHORT='PEAR: Resolver library used to communicate with a DNS'
cat << EOF
A resolver library used to communicate with a
name server to perform DNS queries, zone
transfers, dynamic DNS updates, etc.  Creates an
object hierarchy from a DNS server's response,
which allows you to view all of the information
given by the DNS server.  It bypasses the
system's resolver library and communicates
directly with the server.
