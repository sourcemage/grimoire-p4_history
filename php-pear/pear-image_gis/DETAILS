Generating maps on demand can be a hard job as
most often you don't
have the maps you need in digital form.
But you can generate your own maps based on
raw, digital data files
which are available for free on the net.
This package provides a parser for the most
common format for
geographical data, the Arcinfo/E00 format as
well as renderers to
produce images using GD or Scalable Vector
Graphics (SVG).
