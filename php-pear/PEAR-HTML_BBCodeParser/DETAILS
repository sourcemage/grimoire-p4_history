           SHORT='PEAR: This is a parser to replace UBB style tags with'
cat << EOF
This is a parser to replace UBB style tags with
their html equivalents.
It does not simply do some regex calls, but is
complete stack based parse engine. This ensures
that all tags are properly nested, if not, extra
tags are added to maintain the nesting. This
parser should only produce xhtml 1.0 compliant
code. All tags are validated and so are all
their attributes. It should be easy to extend
this parser with your own tags.

Among the features:
<ul>
<li>set options in a PEAR-style .ini file
<li>user definable open and close tags (defaults
to [ and ])
<li>switch filters on or off
<li>quote html attributes with single or double
quotes, or not at all
<li>optionally produce xml-style closing, for
example for the &lt;img /&gt; tag
<li>set which tags are allowed within other
tags
<li>builtin filters include:
<ul>
<li>Basic ([b], [i], etc)
<li>Email ([email], plus automatic emailaddress
detection and tag insertion)
<li>Images ([img], including width and height
attributes)
<li>Links ([url], including the target
attribute, plus automatic url detection (for
http, https, ftp) and tag insertion)
<li>Lists ([list], [ulist], [li], including the
listtype and start attributes, [li] shorthand
[*], nested lists are possible too)
</ul>
</ul>

Included is an example php script, where
examples for most of the tags are.
