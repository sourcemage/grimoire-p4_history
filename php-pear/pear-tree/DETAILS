           SHORT='PEAR: Generic tree management, currently supports DB'
cat << EOF
Provides methods to read and manipulate trees,
which are stored in the DB
or an XML file. The trees can be stored in the
DB either as nested trees.
Or as simple trees ('brain dead method'), which
use parentId-like structure.
Currently XML data can only be read from a file
and accessed.
The package offers a big number of methods to
access and manipulate trees.
For example methods like: getRoot,
getChild[ren[Ids]], getParent[s[Ids]],
getPath[ById] and many
more.
There are two ways of retreiving the data from
the place where they are stored,
one is by reading the entire tree into the
memory - the Memory way. The other
is reading the tree nodes as needed (very
useful in combination with huge trees
and the nested set model).
The package is designed that way that it is
possible to convert/copy tree data
from either structure to another (from XML into
DB).
