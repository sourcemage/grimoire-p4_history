cat << EOF
The PEAR::Net_Ident implements Identification
Protocol according
to RFC 1413.
The Identification Protocol (a.k.a., "ident",
a.k.a., "the Ident
Protocol") provides a means to determine the
identity of a user
of a particular TCP connection. Given a TCP
port number pair, it
returns a character string which identifies the
owner of that
connection on the server's system.
