	* Spell created. No straightforward way of using PEAR's built-in installation
	  functionality was found, because we don't build /usr/bin/php stand-alone
	  binary in 'php' spell. Instead, contents of downloaded PEAR package are
	  simply copied into /usr/share/pear/. BUILD has a commented-out example
	  of how things ought to be with PEAR.
