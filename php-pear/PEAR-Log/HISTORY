	* Spell created. No straightforward way of using PEAR's built-in
	  installation functionality was found, because we don't build /usr/bin/php
	  stand-alone binary in 'php' spell. Instead, contents of downloaded PEAR
	  package are simply copied into /usr/share/pear/. BUILD has a commented-out
	  example of how things ought to be with PEAR.
