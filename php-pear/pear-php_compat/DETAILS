cat << EOF
PHP_Compat provides missing functionality in the
form of constants and functions for older
versions of PHP.
Note: PHP_Compat can be used without installing
PEAR.
1) Download the package by clicking the
"Download" link.
2) Find the file you need. Each function is in
its own file, e.g. array_walk_recursive.php.
3) Place this file somewhere in your
include_path.
4) Include it, e.g. <?php require_once
'array_walk_recursive.php';?>
The function is now ready to be used.
