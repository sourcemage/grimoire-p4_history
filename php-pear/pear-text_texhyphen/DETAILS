cat << EOF
This package implements the TeX hyphenation
algorithm based on pattern.
The package can support various backends for
pattern retrieval. At this stage only flat
files with TeX pattern were implemented. The
advantage of the TeX pattern is the available
multi-language support. Currently german,
oxford and american english are supported.
For speed purposes an interface for a cache of
hyphenated words was implemented.
