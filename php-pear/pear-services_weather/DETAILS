Services_Weather searches for given locations
and retrieves current
weather data and, dependent on the used
service, also forecasts. Up to
now, GlobalWeather from CapeScience, Weather
XML from EJSE (US only),
a XOAP service from Weather.com and METAR/TAF
from NOAA are supported.
Further services will get included, if they
become available, have a
usable API and are properly documented.
