cat << EOF
XML_HTMLSax is a SAX based XML parser for badly
formed XML documents, such as HTML.
The original code base was developed by
Alexander Zhukov and published at
http://sourceforge.net/projects/phpshelve/,
who in turn was inspired by the Python HTMLSax
package.
Alexander kindly gave permission to modify the
code and license for inclusion in PEAR.
PEAR::XML_HTMLSax takes the last release from
Sourceforge (HTMLSax2002082201) and changes the
API to make using HTMLSax very similar to using
the native PHP Expat extension, opening it up
for use with projects like SAX filters:
http://phpxmlclasses.sourceforge.net/show_doc.ph
p?class=class_sax_filters.html. This version
also fixes some bugs and adds further features
such as the ability to handle processing
instructions and JSP/ASP markup.
