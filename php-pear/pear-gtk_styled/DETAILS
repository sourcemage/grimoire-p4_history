cat << EOF
While it is possible to control some style
elements of a GtkScrollBar,
other elements cannot be controlled so easily.
Items such as the images
at the begining and end (usually arrows) and
the scroll bar that is
dragged to scroll the element cannot be
changed. This leads to
applications that either must conform to the
windowing systems look
and feel or appear incomplete. The goal of this
family of PHP-GTK
classes is to provide all the same
functionality as a normal scroll
bar but allow the user to have better control
over the look and feel.
