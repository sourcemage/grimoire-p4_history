cat << EOF
LiveUser is a set of classes for dealing with
user authentication
and permission management. Basically, there
are three main elements that
make up this package:
* The LiveUser class
* The Auth containers
* The Perm containers
The LiveUser class takes care of the login
process and can be configured
to use a certain permission container and one
or more different auth containers.
That means, you can have your users' data
scattered amongst many data containers
and have the LiveUser class try each defined
container until the user is found.
For example, you can have all website users
who can apply for a new account online
on the webserver's local database. Also, you
want to enable all your company's
employees to login to the site without the
need to create new accounts for all of
them. To achieve that, a second container can
be defined to be used by the LiveUser class.
You can also define a permission container of
your choice that will manage the rights for
each user. Depending on the container, you
can implement any kind of permission schemes
for your application while having one
consistent API.
Using different permission and auth
containers, it's easily possible to integrate
newly written applications with older ones
that have their own ways of storing permissions
and user data. Just make a new container type
and you're ready to go!
Currently available are containers using:
PEAR::DB, PEAR::MDB, PEAR::MDB2,
PEAR::XML_Tree and PEAR::Auth.
