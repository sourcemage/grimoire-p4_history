cat << EOF
Flex enables enterprise-class Rich Internet
Applications and is
designed to address a certain class of
problems around multistep processes,
client-side validation, data manipulation,
and data visualization. This
package allows you to build flex documents
programatically.
MXML is the XML language for writing
Macromedia Flex applications that you
can use to lay out user-interface components.
You can also use MXML to declaratively define
nonvisual aspects of an application,
such as access to server-side data sources
and data bindings between
user-interface components and server-side
data sources.
The API follows closely Stephan Schmidts
XUL-Package.
