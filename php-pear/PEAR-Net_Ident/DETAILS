cat << EOF
The PEAR::Net_Ident implements Identification
Protocol according to RFC
1413.
The Identification Protocol (a.k.a., "ident",
a.k.a., "the Ident
Protocol") provides a means to determine the
identity of a user of a
particular TCP connection.  Given a TCP port
number pair, it returns a
character string which identifies the owner of
that connection on the
server's system.
