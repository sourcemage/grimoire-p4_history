cat << EOF
This is an XML parser based on PHPs built-in xml
extension.
It supports two basic modes of operation:
"func" and "event".  In "func" mode, it will
look for a function named after each element
(xmltag_ELEMENT for start tags and
xmltag_ELEMENT_ for end tags), and in "event"
mode it uses a set of generic callbacks.
Since version 1.2.0 there's a new
XML_Parser_Simple class that makes parsing of
most XML documents easier, by automatically
providing a stack for the elements.
Furthermore its now possible to split the
parser from the handler object, so you do not
have to extend XML_Parser anymore in order to
parse a document with it.
