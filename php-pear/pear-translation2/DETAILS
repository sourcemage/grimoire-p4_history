cat << EOF
This class provides an easy way to retrieve all
the strings for a multilingual site from a data
source (i.e. db).
The following containers are provided, more
will follow:
- PEAR::DB
- PEAR::MDB
- PEAR::MDB2
- gettext
- XML
- PEAR::DB_DataObject (experimental)
It is designed to reduce the number of queries
to the db, caching the results when possible.
An Admin class is provided to easily manage
translations (add/remove a language, add/remove
a string).
Currently, the following decorators are
provided:
- CacheLiteFunction (for file-based caching)
- CacheMemory (for memory-based caching)
- DefaultText (to replace empty strings with
their keys)
- ErrorText (to replace empty strings with a
custom error text)
- Iconv (to switch from/to different encodings)
- Lang (resort to fallback languages for empty
strings)
- SpecialChars (replace html entities with
their hex codes)
- UTF-8 (to convert UTF-8 strings to
ISO-8859-1)
