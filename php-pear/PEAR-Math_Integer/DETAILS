cat << EOF
The class Math_Integer can represent integers
bigger than the
signed longs that are the default of PHP, if
either the GMP or
the BCMATH (bundled with PHP) are present.
Otherwise it will fall
back to the internal integer representation.
The Math_IntegerOp class defines operations on
Math_Integer objects.
