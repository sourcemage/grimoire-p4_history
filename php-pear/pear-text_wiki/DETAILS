           SHORT='PEAR: Transforms Wiki and BBCode markup into XHTML,'
cat << EOF
The text transformation is done in 2 steps.
The chosen parser uses markup rules to tokenize
the tags and content.
Renderers output the tokens and text into the
requested format.
The tokenized form replaces the tags by a
protected byte value associated to an index in
an options table. This form shares up to 50
rules by all parsers and renderers.
The package is intented for versatile
transformers as well as converters.
Text_Wiki is delivered with its own parser,
which is used by Yawiki or Horde's Wicked and
three basic renderers: XHTML , LaTeX and plain
text.
Strong sanitizing of XHTML is default.
Parsers (* and Renderers) exist for BBCode,
Cowiki (*), Dokuwiki (*), Mediawiki and
Tikiwiki (*).
It is highly configurable and can be easily
extended.
