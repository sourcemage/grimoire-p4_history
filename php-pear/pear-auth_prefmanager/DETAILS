cat << EOF
Preference Manager is a class to handle user
preferences in a web application, looking them
up in a table
using a combination of their userid, and the
preference name to get a value, and (optionally)
returning
a default value for the preference if no value
could be found for that user.

It is designed to be used alongside the PEAR
Auth class, but can be used with anything that
allows you
to obtain the user's id - including your own
code.
