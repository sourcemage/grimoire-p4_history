cat << EOF
Package to calculate statistical parameters of
numerical arrays
of data. The data can be in a simple numerical
array, or in a
cummulative numerical array. A cummulative
array, has the value
as the index and the number of repeats as the
value for the
array item, e.g. $data = array(3=>4, 2.3=>5,
1.25=>6, 0.5=>3).
Nulls can be rejected, ignored or handled as
zero values.
Note: You should be using the latest release
(0.9.0beta3 currently), as it fixes problems
with the calculations of several of the
statistics that exist in the stable release.
