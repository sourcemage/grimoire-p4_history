cat << EOF
HTML_Table_Matrix is an extension to HTML_Table
which allows you to easily fill up a table with
data.
Features:
- It uses Filler classes to determine how the
data gets filled in the table. With a custom
Filler, you can fill data in up, down, forwards,
backwards, diagonally, randomly or any other way
you like.
- Comes with Fillers to fill
left-to-right-top-to-bottom and
right-to-left-top-to-bottom.
- Abstract Filler methods keep the code clean &
easy to understand.
- Table height or width may be omitted, and it
will figure out the correct table size based on
the data you provide.
- It integrates handily with Pager to create
pleasant pageable table layouts, such as for an
image gallery. Just specify a height or width,
Filler, and feed it the data returned from
Pager.
- Table may be constrained to a specific height
or width, and excess data will be ignored.
- Fill offset may be specified, to leave room
for a table header, or other elements in the
table.
- Fully documented with PHPDoc.
- Includes fully functional example code.
