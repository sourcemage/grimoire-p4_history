cat << EOF
XML_HTMLSax3 is a SAX based XML parser for badly
formed XML documents, such as HTML.
The original code base was developed by
Alexander Zhukov and published at
http://sourceforge.net/projects/phpshelve/.
Alexander kindly gave permission to modify the
code and license for inclusion in PEAR.
PEAR::XML_HTMLSax3 provides an API very
similar to the native PHP XML extension
(http://www.php.net/xml), allowing handlers
using one to be easily adapted to the other.
The key difference is HTMLSax will not break on
badly formed XML, allowing it to be used for
parsing HTML documents. Otherwise HTMLSax
supports all the handlers available from Expat
except namespace and external entity handlers.
Provides methods for handling XML escapes as
well as JSP/ASP opening and close tags.
Version 1.x introduced an API similar to the
native SAX extension but used a slow character
by character approach to parsing.
Version 2.x has had it's internals completely
overhauled to use a Lexer, delivering
performance *approaching* that of the native
XML extension, as well as a radically improved,
modular design that makes adding further
functionality easy.
Version 3.x is about fine tuning the API,
behaviour and providing a mechanism to
distinguish HTML "quirks" from badly formed
HTML (later functionality not yet implemented)
A big thanks to Jeff Moore (lead developer of
WACT: http://wact.sourceforge.net) who's largely
responsible for new design, as well input from
other members at Sitepoint's Advanced PHP
forums:

Thanks also to Marcus Baker (lead developer
of SimpleTest:
http://www.lastcraft.com/simple_test.php) for
sorting out the unit tests.
