cat << EOF
xSMBrowser is a Gui over the Samba utilities that allows users to easily browse Microsoft networks. It was designed using Linux, but, because it does not use smbfs to view files, it runs on almost all Unix (Solaris, OSF1, NetBSD,...). As seen from the screen shots, it employs an interface similar to Netscape Navigator that is fast and easy to use. Simply put, this is "Network Neighborhood" for Unix.
