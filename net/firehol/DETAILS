cat << EOF
FireHOL a simple yet powerful way to configure stateful iptables firewalls. It
can be used for almost any purpose, including control of any number of
internal/external/virtual interfaces, control of any combination of routed
traffic, setting up DMZ routers and servers, and all kinds of NAT. It provides
strong protection (flooding, spoofing, etc.), transparent caches, source MAC
verification, blacklists, whitelists, and more. Its goal is to be completely
abstracted and powerful but also easy to use, audit, and understand.

As described in freshmeat entry.
