	IMPORTANT: Security bugfix for Samba
	------------------------------------
	Summary
	A security hole has been discovered in versions 2.2.2 through 2.2.6
	of Samba that could potentially allow an attacker to gain root
	access on the target machine. The word "potentially" is used because
	there is no known exploit of this bug, and the Samba Team has not
	been able to craft one ourselves. However, the seriousness of the
	problem warrants this immediate 2.2.7 release. In addition to
	addressing this security issue, Samba 2.2.7 also includes thirteen
	unrelated improvements. These improvements result from our process
	of continuous quality assurance and code review, and are part of the
	Samba team's commitment to excellence. There was a bug in the length
	checking for encrypted password change requests from clients.  A
	client could potentially send an encrypted password, which, when
	decrypted with the old hashed password could be used as a buffer
	overrun attack on the stack of smbd. The attach would have to be
	crafted such that converting a DOS codepage string to little endian
	UCS2 unicode would translate into an executable block of code.  All
	versions of Samba between 2.2.2 to 2.2.6 inclusive are vulnerable to
	this problem. This version of Samba 2.2.7 contains a fix for this
	problem. Earlier versions of Samba are not vulnerable.
