The WWWOFFLE programs simplify World Wide Web browsing from computers that use
intermittent (dialup) connections to the Internet. It is a simple proxy server
with special features for use with dial-up Internet links. It makes it possible
to browse Web pages and read them without having to remain connected. There are
too many features to mention, but they include privacy control, cookie/advert
blocking, efficient bandwidth usage by specifying intervals between refreshes,
options to monitor pages regularly, recursive fetching, HTML cleaning,
highlighting of cached links, indexes of cached pages, searching of cached
pages, and many more.
