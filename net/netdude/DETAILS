Netdude is the NETwork DUmp data Displayer and Editor for tcpdump
tracefiles. It is a GUI-based tool that allows you to make detailed
changes to packets in tcpdump tracefiles. In particular, it can set
the value of every field in IP, TCP, and UDP packet headers, copy,
move, and delete packets in the tracefile, and fragment and
reassemble IP packets. Netdude constantly communicates with a tcpdump 
process to update the familiar tcpdump output that corresponds to the 
trace, which means that any changes made to your local version of
tcpdump are reflected in Netdude. Netdude features a plugin
architecture, and comes with a plugin for checksum correction in IP,
TCP, and UDP and a dummy plugin. Through the plugin mechanism,
Netdude provides a good facility for writing tcpdump trace file
filters.
