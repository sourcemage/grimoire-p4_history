Netwatch is a Linux program created to aid in monitoring Network Connections. 
It is based on a program called "statnet" but has been substantially modified 
for its Ethernet emphasis. It is a dynamic program which displays the Ethernet
status based each the connection's activity. It has the capability of monitoring
hundreds of site statistics simultaneously. The connection's port number 
(Well Known Service) and destination address are available as well. There are 
options which allow router statistics to be measured on simple networks 
(with one router). External network communication is counted and transfer
rates are displayed.
