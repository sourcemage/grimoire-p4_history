Firestarter in a nutshell:

Firestarter is a complete firewall tool for Linux machines. Whether you simply want to protect your personal
workstation or you have a network of computers to secure, Firestarter is here to make your life easier. While a
Firewall does not guarantee security, it is often the first line of defence against network based attacks.

* Key features: The firewall wizard will create a customized firewall in just a few simple steps.
* The real-time firewall hit monitor show attackers probing your defences.
* Open and close ports, deny traffic from aggressors or stealth your services with a few mouse clicks.
* Set up Network Address Translation or port forwarding for your LAN.
* Designed for the GNOME desktop, but works in KDE too.
* Supports Linux kernel versions 2.4 and 2.2.
