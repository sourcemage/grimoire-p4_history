Tor is a toolset for a wide range of organizations and people that want to
improve their safety and security on the Internet. Using Tor can help you
anonymize web browsing and publishing, instant messaging, IRC, SSH, and
more. Tor also provides a platform on which software developers can build
new applications with built-in anonymity, safety, and privacy features.

Your traffic is safer when you use Tor, because communications are bounced
around a distributed network of servers, called onion routers. Instead
of taking a direct route from source to destination, data packets on
the Tor network take a random pathway through several servers that
cover your tracks so no observer at any single point can tell where the
data came from or where it's going. This makes it hard for recipients,
observers, and even the onion routers themselves to figure out who and
where you are. Tor's technology aims to provide Internet users with
protection against "traffic analysis," a form of network surveillance
that threatens personal anonymity and privacy, confidential business
activities and relationships, and state security.
