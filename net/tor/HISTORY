	* BUILD: delete, default build works fine, current BUILD does
	  not run make.
	* DETAILS: use larger description from my version of the spell,
	  fix the license the main site clearly states tor is released
	  under the 3-clause bsd license.
	* DEPENDS: add, this needs libevent to work. These change resolve
	  new spell bug 8668.
