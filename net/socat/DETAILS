           SHORT="Relay for bidirectional data transfer."
cat << EOF
socat is a relay for bidirectional data transfer between two independent data
channels. Each of these data channels may be a file, pipe, device (serial line
etc. or a pseudo terminal), a socket (UNIX, IP4, IP6 - raw, UDP, TCP), an
SSL socket, proxy CONNECT connection, a file descriptor (stdin etc.), the GNU
line editor, a program, or a combination of two of these. 
These modes include generation of "listening" sockets, pipes and pseudo
terminals.
