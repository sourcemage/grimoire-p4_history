                moved config file to /etc/ and the variable output
                to /var/portsentry/

                added David as MAINTAINER (he did all the *real* work  ;^)

                incremented UPDATED

                corrected spelling in portsentry.modes

                changed ":" to "." and Start|Stop to start|stop in init, and
                renamed it. (picky bastard, ain't I?)

		usage mode without recompilation. (Default: Advanced Stealth)
