Modified init.d scripts and added line to autogenerate /etc/rndc.key

Added useful bind documentation, although it helps to already know what
bind is, what it does and how it works.  Paul Albitz's & Cricket Liu's
"DNS and BIND" book by O'Reilly is excellent for learning BIND.

Although bind drops most of root's privlidges after binding to port 53 I
thought that it might still be a good idea to also have bind change it's
user when running to bind for extra security.  I might even modify the
spell so that bind runs in a chrooted jail.  Any comments?  But perhaps
I won't, because I should leave some paranoia available to the SA,
right?
