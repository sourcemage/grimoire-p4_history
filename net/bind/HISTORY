2003-10-01 Eric Sandall <eric@sandall.us>
	* DETAILS: Update to 9.2.2-P3
	* PRE_BUILD: Removed as no extra source to unpack

2003-09-18 Seth Woolley <seth@tautology.org>
	* Added a mkzones.sh file which helps with replication
	  Generates the named.root from dig . ns
	  Chroots to /etc/bind which is actually in /var/chroot/bind (symlink)
	  Patchlevel 1 for fixing broken NXDOMAIN behavior of delegated gTLDs
	  that use wildcard fields
	  Made some more .conf files and some auto-configuring of many files
	  If you are updating from an older version, please consider using
	  the new named.conf file setup and mkzones.sh; seems easier to me.

	* Modified init.d scripts and added line to autogenerate /etc/rndc.key

2002-01-27 Kyle Sallee <anonymous@sourcemage.org>
	* Added useful bind documentation, although it helps to already know
	  what bind is, what it does and how it works. Paul Albitz's & Cricket
	  Liu's "DNS and BIND" book by O'Reilly is excellent for learning
	  BIND. Although bind drops most of root's privlidges after binding
	  to port 53 I thought that it might still be a good idea to also have
	  bind change it's user when running to bind for extra security. I
	  might even modify the spell so that bind runs in a chrooted jail.
	  Any comments? But perhaps I won't, because I should leave some
	  paranoia available to the SA, right?
