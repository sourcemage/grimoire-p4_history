libpcapnav is a libpcap wrapper library that allows navigation to arbitrary
locations in a tcpdump trace file between reads. The API is intentionally much
like that of the pcap library. You can navigate in trace files both in time and
space: you can jump to a packet which is at appr. 2/3 of the trace, or you can
jump as closely as possible to a packet with a given timestamp, and then read
packets from there. In addition, the API provides convenience functions for
manipulating timeval structures.
