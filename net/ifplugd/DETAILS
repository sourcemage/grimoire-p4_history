cat << EOF
ifplugd is a Linux daemon which will automatically configure your ethernet device when a cable is plugged in and automatically unconfigure it if the cable is pulled. This is useful on laptops with onboard network adapters, since it will only configure the interface when a cable is really connected.

ifplugd ifplugd interfaces with your distribution's native network configuration utilities.

Some features:

    * Uses your distribution's native ifup/ifdown programs.
    * May beep when the cable is unplugged, plugged, the interface configuration succeeded or failed.
    * Supports the Linux SIOCETHTOOL (newer, aka ethtool API), SIOCGMIIREG (older, aka mii-diag/mii-tool API) and SIOCDEVPRIVATE (oldest, aka mii-tool API) ioctl()s for getting link status.
    * Syslog support
    * Small program - the binary is just 19 KB (plus 11 KB for libdaemon).
    * Multiple ethernet interface support
    * Can be configured to ignore short "unplugged" periods (-d option) or short "plugged" periods(-u option)
    * Support for wireless networking. Whenever an AP is detected the network is configured.
    * Compatibility mode for network devices which do not support cable detection (-F option)
