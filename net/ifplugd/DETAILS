cat << EOF
ifplugd is a Linux daemon which will automatically configure your ethernet
device when a cable is plugged in and automatically unconfigure it if the cable
is pulled. This is useful on laptops with onboard network adapters, since it
will only configure the interface when a cable is really connected.
