The Network Information Service (NIS) provides a simple network lookup
service consisting of databases and processes. It was formerly known as
Sun Yellow Pages (YP). The functionality of the two remains the same,
only the name has changed. Its purpose is to provide information, that
has to be known throughout the network, to all machines on the network.
