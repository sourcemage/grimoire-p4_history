Netcat6 is a total rewrite of netcat, with several advantages: 

 - It fully supports IPv6. 

 - It is far more efficient, utilizing flexible buffering and minimal
   (or no) data copying or analysis. 

 - The source is well structured, documented and very easy to follow.
   One of the main objectives of netcat6 is to produce an excellent
   example of AF independant networking and efficient data transfer. 
   The code has minimal dependancy on the address family or protocol
   type and can be trivially extended to talk many layer 3 protocols. 

 - Greatly improved configuration and platform indipendence. 

 - Can support servers or clients that use TCP half-close.
