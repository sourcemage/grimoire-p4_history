Cheops-ng is a Network management tool for mapping and 
monitoring your network. It has host/network discovery 
functionality as well as OS detection of hosts. 
Cheops-ng has the ability to probe hosts to see what 
services they are running. On some services, cheops-ng 
is actually able to see what program is running for 
a service and the version number of that program.
