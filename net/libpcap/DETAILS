cat << EOF
This is a handy little library which provides a packet filtering
mechanism based on the BSD packet filter (BPF). Most notably, tcpdump
needs this to work, and there is also a perl module (still in beta)
which can use this as well. In plain english, if you want to write your
own network traffic analyzer, this is the place to start.
