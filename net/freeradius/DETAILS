FreeRADIUS is the premiere open source RADIUS server. While detailed statistics are not available, we believe that FreeRADIUS is well within the top 5 RADIUS servers world-wide, in terms of the number of people who use it daily for authentication. It scales from embedded systems with small amounts of memory, to systems with millions of users. It is fast, flexible, configurable, and supports more authentication protocols than many commercial servers.

The FreeRADIUS Server Project encompasses more than just a RADIUS server. The related software includes a PAM authentication module, and an Apache 1.3 and 2.0 authentication module. The server comes with a PHP-based web user administration tool, called dialupadmin.

The RADIUS server has more features and is more flexible than any other free software RADIUS server, and many commercial servers. Most commercial servers are distributed as a "base" system ($), and an "enhanced" version ($$) with more features. FreeRADIUS has all the features of a commercial "enhanced" server, without the associated cost.
