EthStatus was developed for Linux users that are usually in console mode and it
is based on PPPStatus. It is a simple, easy to use program for displaying
commonly needed / wanted statistics in real time about ingoing and outgoing
traffic that is usually hard to find, with a simple, efficient interface.
