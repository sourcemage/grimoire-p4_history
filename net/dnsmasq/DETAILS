cat << EOF
Dnsmasq is small utility designed to provide DNS (domain name) services to a 
small network connected to the internet via a NAT (network address translation, 
AKA ip-masquerade) firewall and a modem, cable-modem or ADSL connection. 
Since a NAT firewall will pass DNS queries it's perfectly possible for all the 
machines on such a network to be configured to talk directly to the ISP's name 
server, and the HOWTO recommends doing exactly that.
