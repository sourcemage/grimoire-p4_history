           SHORT="NFS is The Network File System"
cat << EOF

The Network File System (NFS) was developed to allow machines to mount
a disk partition on a remote machine as if it were on a local hard
drive. This allows for fast, seamless sharing of files across a network.

It also gives the potential for unwanted people to access your hard
drive over the network (and thereby possibly read your email and delete
all your files as well as break into your system) if you set it up
incorrectly. So please read the Security section of the NFS-HOWTO
carefully if you intend to implement an NFS setup.
