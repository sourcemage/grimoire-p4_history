cat << EOF
ntop shows network usage in a way similar to what top does for processes.
In interactive mode, it displays the network status on the user's terminal.
In Web mode, it acts as a Web server, creating an HTML dump of the network 
status.  It sports a lightweight network IDS (Intrusion Detection System) 
and an HTTP-based client interface for creating ntop-centric monitoring
applications.
