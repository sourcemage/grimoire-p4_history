           SHORT="A IETF Service Location Protocol library"
cat << EOF
Service Location Protocol is an IETF standards track protocol 
that provides a framework to allow networking applications to 
discover the existence, location, and configuration of networked 
services in enterprise networks.  Traditionally, in order to 
locate services on the network, users of network applications 
have been required to supply the host name or network address of 
the machine that provides a desired service.  Ensuring that 
users and applications are supplied with the correct information 
has, in many cases, become an administrative nightmare.

Protocols that support service location are often taken for granted, 
mostly because they are already included (without fanfare) in many 
network operating systems. For example, without Microsoft's SMB 
service location facilities, "Network Neighborhood" could not 
discover services available for use on the network and Novell NetWare 
would be unable to locate NDS trees.  Nevertheless, an IETF service 
location protocol was not standardized until the advent of SLP.  
Because it is not tied to a proprietary technology, SLP provides a 
service location solution that could become extremely important 
(especially on Unix) platforms.
