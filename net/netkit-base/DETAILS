This is netkit-base for Linux.
The rpcgen and rpcinfo programs are no longer distributed in
netkit-base. If you are using glibc (that is, glibc 2.0, 2.1, or
higher, as opposed to Linux libc 4.x or 5.x), please use the rpcgen
and rpcinfo that come with glibc. If you are using an older libc that
does not include rpcgen and rpcinfo, you can find the old netkit
versions in the netkit-rpc package.
