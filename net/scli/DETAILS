           SHORT="scli - SNMP Command Line Interface"
cat << EOF
The scli package was written to address the need for 
small and efficient command line utilities to monitor and 
configure network devices and host systems. The scli 
package is based on the SNMP management protocol. It 
utilizes a MIB compiler called smidump to generate C stub 
code. In fact, virtually no SNMP knowledge is required in 
order to extend the scli programs with new features.
