EthStatus was developed for Linux users that are usually in console
mode and it is based on PPPStatus. It is a simple, easy to use
program for displaying commonly needed / wanted statistics in real
time about ingoing and outgoing traffic that is usually hard to
find, with a simple, efficient interface.
