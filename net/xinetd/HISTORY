                Added this History file.
		added tcp_wrappers as optional dependancy,
		until now, we have *not* had tcp_wrapper support
		for xinetd daemons!

		I have also added (default) support for the max_load config
		option, thereby allowing the admin to disable individual
		services if the system's load is above a specified level.
