cat << EOF
xinetd is a replacement for inetd, the internet services daemon. Anybody
can use it to start servers that don't require privileged ports because
xinetd does not require that the services in its configuration file be
listed in /etc/services. It can do access control on all services based
on the address of the remote host and time of access. Access control
works on all services, whether multi-threaded or single-threaded and for
both the TCP and UDP protocols. xinetd supports both internal access
control, and the use of the libwrap library. IPv6 with access control is
also supported.
