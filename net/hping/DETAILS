           SHORT="hping is a TCP/IP packet assembler/analyzer."
cat << EOF
hping is a command-line oriented TCP/IP packet assembler/analyzer. The 
interface is inspired to the ping(8) unix command, but hping isn't only 
able to send ICMP echo requests. It supports TCP, UDP, ICMP and RAW-IP 
protocols, has a traceroute mode, the ability to send files between a 
covered channel, and many other features.
While hping was mainly used as a security tool in the past, it can be used 
in many ways by people that don't care about security to test networks and 
hosts. A subset of the stuff you can do using hping:

    * Firewall testing
    * Advanced port scanning
    * Network testing, using different protocols, TOS, fragmentation
    * Manual path MTU discovery
    * Advanced traceroute, under all the supported protocols
    * Remote OS fingerprinting
    * Remote uptime guessing
    * TCP/IP stacks auditing
