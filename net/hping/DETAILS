cat << EOF
A command-line oriented TCP/IP packet assembler/analyzer. The interface is
inspired to the ping(8) unix command, but hping isn't only able to send ICMP
echo requests. It supports TCP, UDP, ICMP and RAW-IP protocols, has a
traceroute mode, the ability to send files between a covered channel, and many
other features.  While hping was mainly used as a security tool in the past, it
can be used in many ways by people that don't care about security to test
networks and hosts. A subset of the stuff you can do using hping:

    * Firewall testing
    * Advanced port scanning
    * Network testing, using different protocols, TOS, fragmentation
    * Manual path MTU discovery
    * Advanced traceroute, under all the supported protocols
    * Remote OS fingerprinting
    * Remote uptime guessing
    * TCP/IP stacks auditing
