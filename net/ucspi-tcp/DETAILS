cat << EOF
tcpclient and tcpserver are easy-to-use command-line tools for building
TCP client-server applications. tcpclient makes a TCP connection and
runs a program of your choice. tcpserver waits for incoming connections
and, for each connection, runs a program of your choice. Your program
receives environment variables showing the local and remote host names,
IP addresses, and port numbers.

tcpserver offers a concurrency limit to protect you from running out of
processes and memory. When you are handling 40 (by default) simultaneous
connections, tcpserver smoothly defers acceptance of new connections.

tcpserver also provides TCP access control features, similar to
tcp-wrappers/tcpd's hosts.allow but much faster. Its access control
rules are compiled into a hashed format with cdb, so it can easily deal
with thousands of different hosts.

tcpclient and tcpserver conform to UCSPI, the UNIX Client-Server Program
Interface, using the TCP protocol. UCSPI tools are available for several
different networks.
