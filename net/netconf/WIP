	the new options need testing before it's pulled into test.
	I don't want to break lot's of networks by accident ;)

	fixed the handling of keys, feedback is welcome!
	Add it to this WIP, send it by mail, add it to the bug,
	tell me on #sourcemage, write a letter, sing a song, whatever.
	As long as we avoid the same thing that happened with the
	previous version: it hit stable with a bug in it...
