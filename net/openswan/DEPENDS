# from the readme from openswan
#* For the moment, users wishing to test Openswan with 2.6 will require
#  ipsec-tools' "setkey" program. Though Openswan's keying daemon, Pluto,
#  directly sets IPsec policy, setkey is currently required to reset kernel SPD 
#  (Security Policy Database) states when Pluto restarts. We will likely add 
#  this basic functionality to an upcoming Openswan release.
