cat << EOF
Openswan is an implementation of IPsec for Linux. It supports kernels 2.0,
2.2, 2.4 and 2.6, and runs on many different platforms, including x86, ia64, 
mips and arm. It is a code fork of the FreeS/WAN project, started by a few of 
the developers who were growing frustrated with the politics surrounding the 
FreeS/WAN project.

IPSEC is Internet Protocol SECurity. It uses strong cryptography to provide
both authentication and encryption services. Authentication ensures that
packets are from the right sender and have not been altered in transit.
Encryption prevents unauthorised reading of packet contents.

These services allow you to build secure tunnels through untrusted networks.
Everything passing through the untrusted net is encrypted by the IPSEC gateway
machine and decrypted by the gateway at the other end. The result is Virtual
Private Network or VPN. This is a network which is effectively private even
though it includes machines at several different sites connected by the
insecure Internet.
