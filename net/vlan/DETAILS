cat << EOF
Features:
  * Implements 802.1Q VLAN spec.
  * Implements support for a non-standard (as far as I know) MAC-based VLAN functionality.
  * Can support up to 4094 VLANs per ethernet interface.
  * Scales well in critical paths: O(n), where n is the number of PHYSICAL ethernet interfaces,
    and that is only on ingress. O(1) in every other critical path, as far as I know.
  * Supports MULTICAST
  * Can change MAC address of VLAN.
  * Multiple naming conventions supported, and adjustable at runtime.
  * Optional header-reordering, to make the VLAN interface look JUST LIKE an Ethernet interface.
    This fixes some problems with DHCPd and anything else that uses a SOCK_PACKET socket.
    Default setting is off, which works for every other protocol I know about, and is slightly faster.
