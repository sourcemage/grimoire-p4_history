cat << EOF
A bandwidth measurement tool. It was inspired by pathchar, but 
the algorithm itself is much more elementary. It basically (and
sometimes accurately) assumes that latency is proportional to 
available bandwidth. This isn't going to be accurate on high-latency 
mediums like satellite. Worth a "just-for-fun" run.
