		Fix for ifup from Robert

2003-09-23  Robert Helgesson <rycee@home.se>

		Update of network device file format, completely backwards
		compatible. You can now define the following functions in a
		device file (found in /etc/sysconfig/network): do_device_up,
		do_device_down, do_route_up, do_route_down, do_status, on_up
		and on_down. The following new variables are also available:
		MTU and POINTTOPOINT.

2003-09-19  Seth Woolley <seth@tautology.org>

		fixed network init.d script to not inherit echo override
		when running ifup/ifdown subscripts.

2003-09-16  Robert Helgesson <rycee@home.se>

		added dhcpcd.conf which allows the user to specify whether
		syslog should be used and how long the timeout should be, also
		fixes bug #4253.

2003-08-27  Robert Helgesson <rycee@home.se>

		fixed ifup and ifdown (bug #3959, #4165)

2003-08-27  Ladislav Hagara <hgr@vabo.cz>

		echo in mountnetwork script must be without option "-n"

		before:
		Starting sshd...filesystems...
		now:
		Mounting remote filesystems...
		Starting sshd...

2003-08-26  Eric Schabell <eschabell@sourcemage.org>

		fixed ifdown problem, probing the modules table
		was resulting in double entries being returned,
		now unique and networking goes down (thanks to basvg).

2003-08-22  Robert Helgesson <rycee@home.se>

		fixed bug #3959
		network init script now uses required_executable

2003-08-22  hgg <hgreig@bigpond.net.au>

		Update UPDATED purely for test grimoire integration.

2003-08-03  Seth Woolley <seth@tautology.org>

		Changed to support init script logging.

2003-08-01  Eric Sandall <eric@sandall.us>

		network (when using dhcpcd) uses syslog
		(dhcpcd -d)

		Still need to make loading modules not
		display all the information, should use
		syslog (modprobe -s), but that still doesn't
		help, nor does '-q' (at least with my 3c59x)

2003-07-31  Eric Sandall <eric@sandall.us>

		Added init.d/mountnetwork to mount networked
		filesystems, such as NFS, SaMBa, etc.

2003-07-28  Arwed v. Merkatz <v.merkatz@gmx.net>

		updated to new init system
		hostname.sh is now installed by init.d

2003-07-27  Robert Helgesson <rycee@home.se>

		applied patch from Arwed (bug #3842)
		modified networking init script to use ifup and ifdown
		added some &&-chains to ifup/ifdown plus some cosmetic changes

2003-07-25  Arwed v. Merkatz <v.merkatz@gmx.net>

		added ifup and ifdown scripts

2003-07-23  Eric Sandall <eric@sandall.us>

2003-07-22  Casey Harkins <charkins@pobox.com>

      Moved netconf tool to its own spell, added netconf
      to DEPENDS and removed netconf installation line
      from BUILD.

2003-07-18  hgg <hgreig@bigpond.net.au>

		Add TRIGGER on coreutils as they both provide hostname
		but this one works

2003-07-12  Eric Sandall <eric@sandall.us>

		No longer says "Starting /etc/rc3.d/S30networking..."  :)

2003-06-26  Eric Schabell <eschabell@sourcemage.org>

		Applied fixes as given by Casey in bug #3531, 
		which fixes this bug! Finally! ;-)

2003-06-19  Casey Harkins <charkins@pobox.com>

		Added netconf tool for configuring network devices.
		The tool is installed in /usr/sbin from BUILD. The
		"configure network devices" prompt was moved from
		CONFIGURE into POST_INSTALL and simply calls
		/usr/sbin/netconf when the user answers yes. Removed
		lib_netsetup as it is no longer needed. This and a
		patch to the installer should resolve bug #3531.

		of /etc/sysconfig/network

2003-03-06  Eric Schabell <eschabell@sourcemage.org>

		whoops, we still need lib_netsetup, put back!
		fixes bug #2711, sorry guys. Also have fixed 
		problem with install_network function so it

		exists.
