		Added netconf tool for configuring network devices.
		The tool is installed in /usr/sbin from BUILD. The
		"configure network devices" prompt was moved from
		CONFIGURE into POST_INSTALL and simply calls
		/usr/sbin/netconf when the user answers yes. Removed
		lib_netsetup as it is no longer needed. This and a
		patch to the installer should resolve bug #3531.
