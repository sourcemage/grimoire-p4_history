cat << EOF
trickle is a portable lightweight userspace bandwidth shaper. it can run in collaborative mode 
(together with trickled) or in stand alone mode.
trickle works by taking advantage of the unix loader preloading. essentially it provides, to the 
application, a new version of the functionality that is required to send and receive data through 
sockets. it then limits traffic based on delaying the sending and receiving of data over a socket. 
trickle runs entirely in userspace and does not require root privileges.
developed on openbsd (i386); tested on openbsd (sparc, sparc64, macppc), solaris (sparc, 
sparc64), netbsd (alpha), linux (i386) and freebsd (i386).
mentioned on sweetcode.
