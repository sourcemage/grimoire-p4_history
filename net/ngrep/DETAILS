ngrep strives to provide most of GNU grep's common features, applying them to
the network layer.  ngrep is a pcap-aware tool that will allow you to specify 
extended regular or hexadecimal expressions to match against data payloads of
packets.  It currently recognizes TCP, UDP, and ICMP across Ethernet, PPP, SLIP,FDDI, Token Ring, and null interfaces, and understands bpf filter logic in the
same fashion as more common packet sniffing tools, such as tcpdump and snoop.
