Nagios is a host and service monitor designed to inform you of network 
problems before your clients, end-users or managers do. It has been 
designed to run under the Linux operating system, but works fine under most 
*NIX variants as well. The monitoring daemon runs intermittent checks on hosts 
and services you specify using external "plugins" which return status 
information to Nagios. When problems are encountered, the daemon can send 
notifications out to administrative contacts in a variety of different ways 
(email, instant message, SMS, etc.). Current status information, historical 
logs, and reports can all be accessed via a web browser.
