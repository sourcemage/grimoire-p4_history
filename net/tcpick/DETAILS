cat << EOF
Tcpick is a textmode sniffer libpcap-based that can track, reassemble and reorder tcp streams. 
Tcpick is able to save the captured flows in different files or displays them in the terminal, 
and so it is useful to sniff files that are transmitted via ftp or http. It can display all the 
stream on the terminal, when the connection is closed in different display modes like hexdump, 
hexdump + ascii, only printable charachters, raw mode and so on. Available a color mode too, 
helpful to read and understand better the output of the program. Actually it can handle several interfaces, 
including ethernet cards and ppp. It is useful to keep track of what users of a network are doing, 
and is usable with textmode tools like grep, sed, awk. <http://tcpick.sourceforge.net>
