Linux FreeS/WAN is an implementation of IPSEC & IKE for Linux.

IPSEC is Internet Protocol SECurity. It uses strong cryptography to provide
both authentication and encryption services. Authentication ensures that
packets are from the right sender and have not been altered in transit.
Encryption prevents unauthorised reading of packet contents.

These services allow you to build secure tunnels through untrusted networks.
Everything passing through the untrusted net is encrypted by the IPSEC gateway
machine and decrypted by the gateway at the other end. The result is Virtual
Private Network or VPN. This is a network which is effectively private even
though it includes machines at several different sites connected by the
insecure Internet.
