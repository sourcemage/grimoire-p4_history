cat << EOF
Pktstat displays a real-time list of active connections seen on a network interface, and how much bandwidth 
is being used by what. Partially decodes HTTP and FTP protocols to show what filename is being transferred. 
X11 application names are also shown. Entries hang around on the screen for a few seconds so you can see 
what just happened. Also accepts filter expressions ? la tcpdump. <http://www.adaptive-enterprises.com.au/~d/software/pktstat>
