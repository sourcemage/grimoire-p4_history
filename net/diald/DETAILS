Diald is an intelligent link management tool originally named for its ability
to control dial-on-demand network connections. 

Diald monitors traffic through a network interface and presents connection and
utilization details to monitor programs such as dctrl. 

Diald can be configured to bring on-demand links up and down as required -
either by user request or by specific types of packet. 

Diald is not limited to traditional on-demand links such as modems and ISDN.
It can be used to manage any network interface. You could, for instance, use
it to manage a WAN interface which is chargable on a per-packet basis.
