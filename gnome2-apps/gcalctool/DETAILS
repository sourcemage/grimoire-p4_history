cat << EOF
GCalctool is a desktop caclulator. It has been designed
to be used with either the mouse or keyboard.  It is 
visually similar to a lot of hand-held caclulators. There
are financial, logical, and scientific modes. Similar
operations are color coded. Some of the calculator keys
have menu marks. This indicates that there is a menu
associated with that key.
