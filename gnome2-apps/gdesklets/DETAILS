gDesklets provides an advanced architecture for desktop applets
-- tiny displays sitting on your desktop in a symbiotic 
relationship of eye candy and usefulness.
Populate your desktop with status meters, icon bars, weather sensors, 
news tickers... whatever you can imagine! Virtually anything is 
possible and maybe even available some day.
