           SHORT="gnome applet for swallow - embed small app in the panel"
cat << EOF
A very useful feature of orignal Gnome panel was the ability
to "swallow" other programs -- to embed small applications
in the panel, even if the application was not specifically
written for Gnome. Unfortunately, with the release of Gnome2
this feature was removed. In a discussion on the Gnome mailing
list, it was pointed out that this could feature could be
easily re-added using a specialized "swallower" applet,
and that such as solution would be cleaner and more modular
besides. Despite this, no one (to my knowledge) had yet
written such an applet...
