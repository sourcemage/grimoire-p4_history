A nixie tube clock for GNOME.

I have always liked the look of so-called "nixie" tubes,
those old numeric displays they used to use before LED's.

Right now the clock is simple but usable. It has a 12/24
hour mode and you can choose between two display sizes.
A few more features are coming (see TODO).

However, because the clock is really just a frontend
to displaying images representing the digits and background,
the look can easily be changed, given new artwork.
If you want to contribute new artwork, let me know!
