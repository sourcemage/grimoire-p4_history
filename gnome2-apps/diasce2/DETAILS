cat << EOF
DiaSCE is C, C++ code editor for Gnome. It pretends to be a complement 
to Glade, so it doesn't include an environment for GUI's development. 
It has neither a debugger or other kind of tool to help debugging. 
The goal is to provide light code editor that doesn't need too many 
resources.
