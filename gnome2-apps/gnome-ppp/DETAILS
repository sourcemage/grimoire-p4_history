cat << EOF
GNOME PPP is a modem dialup tool designed to integrate nicely 
into GNOME 2 Desktop Environment. It is very similar to GPPP 
dialup utility created for GNOME 1 and KDE equivalent, KPPP. 
Since it is a graphical frontend for excellent WvDial, very 
little knowledge is needed to setup dialup connection using 
GNOME PPP. It features ease of use, auto detection of your 
modem and connection monitoring.
