What is gnome-pkgview?
Currently, there is no easy way of determining which version of GNOME you are running. 
Its a common question on IRC and on mailing lists. This makes the task of debugging 
and providing support more difficult for those who try to help out. This little 
application provides a couple of useful pieces of information:
Desktop Version
Firstly, gnome-pkgview displays the overall desktop version. This is currently tucked 
away in a file called gnome-version.xml which is part of the gnome-desktop package.
Library Versions
The frequent answer to the question 'what version of GNOME am I running?' is 'there is 
no single version, it depends on the libraries'. So gnome-pkgview attempts to find 
installed desktop components via pkg-config's .pc files. It extracts the name, version, 
prefix and a short description of each package it finds.
