cat << EOF
Rhythmbox Applet is a small, simple GNOME panel applet that lets you control 
Rhythmbox's playback from a panel.

Advantages that this applet has over using the icon Rhythmbox puts in the 
notification area include:

    * One-click access to the main operations needed during playback, 
      without needing to use a context menu.
    * Display of the current playing time without requiring a mouse-over.
    * Display of the current song's album in the song information.
    * More in the spirit of the GNOME Human Interface Guidelines. 
      The notification area is intended primarily for notifying the user 
      of events, not as a secondary means of control.
