Gnome Clipboard Manager 2.0 is an application made for managing your selections 
(a.k.a. clipboards). Gcm will (if this option is set) automatically fetch new 
selections and will push all the targets of that selection on a shelve. Once 
collected, it is possible using Gcm to go back to a previous collected selection 
(which is a collection of targets) by selecting it, edit the targets of your 
chosen selection, merge them into a new selection on the shelf from multiple 
marked selections, save to -and load selected selections to XML files. While 
editing the selection you can modify the COMPOUND_TEXT and text/html targets. 
While editing the text/html target you can see a preview of the  data using the 
GtkHtml widget.
