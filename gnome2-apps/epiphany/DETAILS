Epiphany aims to utilize the simplest interface possible for a browser. Keep in
mind that simple does not necessarily mean less powerful. We believe the
commonly used browsers of today are too big, buggy, and bloated. Epiphany
addresses simplicity with a small browser designed for the web -- not mail,
newsgroups, file management, instant messenging or coffee making. The UNIX
philosophy is to design small tools that do one thing, and do it well.
