Grisbi is a personnal accounting application running under Linux, written with Gnome and 
Gtk, and is released under the GPL licence.

Our aim is to provide you with the most simple and intuitive software for basic use, and 
still very powerful if you spend a little time on the setup.

Grisbi is an application written by French developpers, so it perfectly respects French 
accounting rules. Grisbi can manage multiple accounts, currencies and users. It manages 
third party, expenditure and receipt categories, as well as budgetary lines, financial 
years, and other informations that makes it quite adapted for associations (except those 
that require double entry accounting). The exhaustive list of Grisbi's functionalities can 
be found in the User's guide, paragraph 1.2.
