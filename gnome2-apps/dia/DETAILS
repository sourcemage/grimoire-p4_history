cat << EOF
Dia is a program for creating diagrams of all kinds. The current
version can do UML class diagrams, Entity-Relationship modeling,
network diagrams, and much more. The engine is very flexible and
dynamically loads diagram-types from disk. It can currently export to 
PostScript and load/save in an XML format.
