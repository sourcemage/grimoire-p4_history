KBiff is a "biff" or new mail notification utility. It is highly configurable
but very easy to use and setup. It tries to combine the best of the features of
most of the "other" biff programs out there. 

KBiff supports all major mailbox formats: mbox (Berkely style), maildir, mh,
POP3, IMAP4, and NNTP. As of 3.7, it also supports POP3 and IMAP4 with SSL.
