KGuitar was started for developing an efficient and easy-to-use environment
for a guitarist.  There are many tasks that guitarists do every day and that
can be made easier to do when using computer.  Examples of such tasks include
finding of chord fingerings, writing & reading tabulatures, converting classic
note score to the tabulature form and vice versa, transposition of the whole
song or its parts and many others.

KGuitar has support for guitar, drums, classic note scores, MIDI synthesizer
output, chords, scales, modes, melody and rhythm construction and analysis
tools, and many tab effects.  It can import Guitar Pro 4 files.

The main features of KGuitar include: 
  *  Free GPLed program.
  *  K Desktop Environment GUI.
  *  Powerful and convenient tabulature editing, including many effects and
     classical note score editing for classic instrument players.
  *  Full and very customizable MIDI to tabulature import and export.
  *  Support of extra data formats, such as ASCII tabulatures or popular
     programs' format, such as Guitar Pro's or TablEdit.
  *  Chord fingering construction tools - chord finder & chord analyzer.
  *  Highly customizable to suit a lot of possible instruments (not only
     6-stringed guitars, and even not only guitars), including drum tracks,
     lyrics and other MIDI events.
