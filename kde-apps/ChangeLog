	most of the spells in the kde section have now been converted to BUILD_API=2
	this means that sorcery-1.10 is required most of the kde spells now have a
	configure option to allow the user to choose either the stable or
	development verion of kde. the default is the stable version.
	Currently version 3.2.2  and 3.2.90 are provided
	3.2.2 has problems with gcc-3.4.0, whereas 3.2.90 builds correctly
