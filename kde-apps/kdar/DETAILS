KDar is the KDE Disk Archiver. It is a convenient graphical interface to Denis Corbin's libdar archiving and backup C++ library. You can safely backup (with compression if you like), view and restore files using KDar, along with a few easy UNIX commands for mounting and burning CD-R's, Zip and Jazz drives, DVD-R's, floppies, or any other disk-based storage media.
