cat << EOF
Hayes is the playlist for Noatun 2.0 / KDE 3.0 that attempts to be efficent
for those users with large directories full of music, especially directories
futher organized by album. For these users, Hayes should be more efficient
in speed and memory than the usual playlist. Plus, the playlist is updated
in realtime as the directories change on-disk, so playlist maintenance is no
longer an issue.
