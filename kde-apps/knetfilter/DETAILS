cat << EOF
Knetfilter is a KDE application designed to manage the netfilter
functionalities that come with the kernels 2.4 and later. In principle, all
standard firewall system administration activities can be done just using
knetfilter. But there is not just a GUI to iptables comand line, it is also
possible to monitor the network with tcpdump and nmap interfaces.
