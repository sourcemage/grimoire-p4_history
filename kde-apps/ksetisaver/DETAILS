           SHORT="A KDE screensaver frontend for the Linux Seti@Home client"
cat << EOF
The Seti@Home project offers two different types of clients: A client with a
graphical GUI and a pure command line client.  Unfortunately for Linux there's
only a command client available. The command line client is quite fast compared
to the Windows GUI version, but in my opinion WU crunching is much more fun when
you can look on some cool graphics from time to time to really "see" what you
are doing. Ok, this is the point where KSetiSaver kicks in: It acts as a normal
screensaver for KDE. When it is launched it starts monitoring a Seti@Home
client.
