KDE Image Database (KimDaBa) is a tool for indexing, searching, and viewing images. 
The indexing is done by telling KimDaBa who is on the images, where the images were 
taken, and (optionally) adding descriptions. KimDaBa is highly optimized for easy 
indexing of images, so that it is possible to use it with thousands of images. It 
also allows you to browse your images easily, based on the properties (person, 
location, keywords) you specified when indexing.
