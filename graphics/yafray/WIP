problems:
their scons script seems to be broken... it will eat up all available memory+swap.
apparently a problem with scons doing an md5sum of everything of the frigging system.

Tried to get rid of "local", still the same. :-(
Only works "scons; scons install"

sedit "s:/local::" SConstruct                      &&
sedit "s:/local::" conf.doxygen                    &&
sedit "s:/local::" configio.py                     &&
sedit "s:/local::" darwin-settings.py              &&
sedit "s:/local::" linux-settings.py               &&

sedit "s:/local::" src/loader/render.h             &&
