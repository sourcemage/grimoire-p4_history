The GIMP is the GNU Image Manipulation Program. It is a freely
distributed piece of software suitable for such tasks as photo
retouching, image composition and image authoring. It can be used as a
simple paint program, an expert quality photo retouching program, an
online batch processing system, a mass production image renderer, a
image format converter, etc. GIMPshop renamed and reorganized GIMP’s 
tools, options, windows, and menus to closely resemble Adobe Photoshop’s 
menu structure and naming conventions.
