Pngcrush is an optimizer for PNG (Portable Network Graphics) files. It 
can be run from a commandline in an MSDOS window, or from a UNIX or 
LINUX commandline.

Its main purpose is to reduce the size of the PNG IDAT datastream by 
trying various compression levels an PNG filter methods. It also can be 
used to remove unwanted ancillary chunks, or to add certain chunks 
including gAMA, tRNS, iCCP, and textual chunks.
