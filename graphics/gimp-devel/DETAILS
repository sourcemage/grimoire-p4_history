The GIMP is the GNU Image Manipulation Program. It is a freely
distributed piece of software suitable for such tasks as photo
retouching, image composition and image authoring. It can be used as a
simple paint program, an expert quality photo retouching program, an
online batch processing system, a mass production image renderer, a
image format converter, etc. This is the developers version 1.3. You
may want to cast gimp instead of gimp-devel for the stable version.
