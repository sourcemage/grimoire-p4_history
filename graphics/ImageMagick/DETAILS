ImageMagick (TM) is a package for the automated and interative manipulation
of images.  It supports the display and interactive manipulation of images
when used with the X Window System.  Although the software is copyrighted, it
is available for free and can be redistributed without fee.  ImageMagick may
be used as a component of both open source and proprietary applications.
ImageMagick compiles and runs under Unix, Linux, Windows '95 and later, Apple
MacOS, and Compaq VMS.  Binary packages are available for most operating
systems.  Application programming interfaces (APIs) are provided to support
development of image processing applications in the C, C++, and Perl
languages.
