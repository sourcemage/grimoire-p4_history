2003-03-09  Eric Sandall <eric@sandall.us>

		Added dependency on ode (as some systems seem
		to need this to compile) for GameBlender, thanks
		to Chris Brien (removed from CONFIGURE), but it
		is going to be commented out as GameBlender is
		disabled in this version.

		Added TRIGGERS on ode, as it builds static
		libraries, thanks to Robert Helgesson

		Moved CONFIGURE option for plugin support to
		DEPENDS, as it requires mozilla anyways.
		(removed CONFIGURE, as it is now unneeded)

		Added dependency on Python

		Added optional dependencies for mozilla,
