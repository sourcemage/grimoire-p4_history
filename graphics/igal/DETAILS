[ What is iGal? ]

iGal is a Perl-based program that can generate and publish an entire 
online picture show (HTML slides, thumbnails and index page included) 
with just one command line invocation in a Linux or Unix environment. 
If you've got a directory (or several) full of image files that are 
waiting to be put online and shared with friends, then iGal is for you.

[ Features ]

    * flexible, well documented
    * handles JPG and GIF images
    * 99% configurable through command line options and two HTML template files
    * generated slides use a javascript trick to preload the next image 
    in the slide show (great for those viewing your gallery over slow 
    connections)
    * relies on programs already included with most Linux distributions 
    (libjpeg [src, rpm] and ImageMagick [src, rpm], the latter being 
    optional), not on non-standard Perl modules
    * should easily install and work on any Unix-like OS
