Ocrad is an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) program implemented 
as a filter and based on a feature extraction method. It reads a 
bitmap image in pbm format and outputs text in ISO-8859-1 (Latin-1) 
charset. 
 It can be used as a stand-alone console application, or as a backend 
to other programs.
