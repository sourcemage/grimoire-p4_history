OpenEXR is a high dynamic-range (HDR) image file format developed by Industrial Light & Magic for use in computer imaging applications.

OpenEXR has already been used by ILM on 4 major motion pictures -- Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, Men in Black II, Gangs of New York, and Signs -- and is also being used on several other movies currently in production.
