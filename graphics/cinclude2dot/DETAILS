cat << EOF
This is the Perl script which analyses C/C++ code and produces a #include dependency graph. The output from the script is a dot file for input into graphviz. This is an improved version of the original script, which you can find here. Many thanks to Darxus for creating the original. The new version adds directory clustering, file include path searching and various other features. Both are licensed under the GPL.
