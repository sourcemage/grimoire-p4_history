  - Modified makefile so that it uses the systems libpng and zlib instead of POVRay's.
  - Modifed povrayrc so that POVRay's libs are in /usr/lib rather than the default (/usr/local/lib).
  - Added option to ask SA if he/she wants a copy of /etc/povrayrc put in every users directory.

	Update to 3.5
	Total rewrite due to new make system.
	Happened to make Eric's changes kind of obsolete.
