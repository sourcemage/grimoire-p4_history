Springgraph will read in a .dot file description of a graph, which, for each node, specifies its name and which other nodes it is connected to, and then renders a graph. Each node is drawn as an ellipse, and each connection is drawn as an arrow. The node placement is a result of all of the nodes moving away from each other, while all nodes which are connected move toward each other. This movement is repeated until it stabilizes.

Springgraph was written as an alternative to neato, which is part of graphviz. It attempts to read the same .dot files used by graphviz, but currently only supports a limited number of node attributes (label and fillcolor). I am open to requests for support for more graph/node/edge attributes. I have used neato quite a lot since September of 2000, when I started writing programs to convert apache log files, gpg/pgp keyring signature relationships, and C include relationships to .dot files to be graphed with neato.
