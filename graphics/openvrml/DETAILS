cat << EOF
OpenVRML is a C++ class library that allows applications to read
VRML97 .wrl files and view their geometries.  It is also working
toward full ISO VRML97 Specification compliance.  While still in
development, the codebase is quite stable and featureful.

Lookat, a basic VRML viewer, is included.
