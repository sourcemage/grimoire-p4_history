Your scanner will need to be configured. Go to /usr/etc/sane.d/myscanner and
configure it. Insure that the way your scanner is connected is defined in your
/dev/scanner|sg0|sga or /devices/usb/scanner0, note: how SMGL devfs is set up
uniquely and does not follow the convention used by the myscanner.conf files.

As root run 'scanimage -L' to validate that sane sees your scanner (PWR ON).
