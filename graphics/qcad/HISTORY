	* Makefile: You know, why compress a large file when all that
	  does is slow down the grimoire tarball creation later on and also
	  slow down the install by adding more overhead to the user's cast? I
	  did this to save modem user's time, but it'll be compressed anyways
	  in the tarball. :)

2002-09-06 Eric Sandall <eric@sandall.us>
