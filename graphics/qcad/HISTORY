		You know, why compress a large file when all that doess is slow down the grimoire tarball
		creation later on and also slow down the install by adding more overhead to the user's cast?
		I did this to save modem user's time, but it'll be compressed anyways in the tarball.  :)

		Modified Makefile to use SMGL's CFLAGS and not built-in ones for QCAD
		Modifed BUILD to track the files installed using 'install' instead of 'cp'
