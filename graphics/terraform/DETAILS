cat << EOF
Terraform allows you to create fractal terrain (also called a 
height field) and transform it using a number of algorithms. 
It is meant to be a tool for those who want to generate 
digital terrain models for use in raytracing or other 
simulations. Terraform features different views and colormaps 
and has a preview mode which features interactive real-time 
rotation of the terrain object. Terraform is written for the 
GNOME desktop environment.
