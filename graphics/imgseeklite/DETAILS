imgSeekLite is the smaller more portable version of imgSeek. imgSeek is 
a photo collection manager and viewer with content-based 
search and many other features. The query is expressed either as a rough 
sketch painted by the user or as another image you supply (or an image 
in your collection). The searching algorithm makes use of 
multiresolution wavelet decomposition of the query and database images.
