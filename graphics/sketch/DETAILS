cat << EOF
Sketch is a vector drawing program similar to 
CorelDraw or Adobe Illustrator. It is written almost 
completely in Python with some modules written in C, 
combining the flexibility and power of Python with the 
speed of C. Advanced features include gradient fills, 
clip masks, text along a path, blend groups, convert 
text to curves, and more.
