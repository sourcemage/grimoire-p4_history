Remember is an emacs mode for remembering data.  It uses whatever
back-end is appropriate to record and correlate the data, but it's
main intention is to allow you to express as _little_ structure as
possible up front.  If you later want to express more powerful
relationships between your data, or state assumptions that were at
first too implicit to be recognized, you can "study" the data later
and rearrange it.  But the initial "just remember this" impulse
should be as close to simply throwing the data at Emacs as
possible.
