cat << EOF
Aspell is a spell checker designed to eventually replace ispell. Its
main feature is that it does a much better job of coming up with
possible suggestions than ispell does. It also has support for checking
(La)TeX and HTML files, and run-time support for other non-English
languages. Aspell also is a library; however, the recommended way to use
aspell is through the Pspell library, as the actual interface to the
aspell library is constantly changing.
