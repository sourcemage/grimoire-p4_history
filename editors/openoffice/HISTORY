  		* After spending weeks attempting to build OpenOffice, I 
		  decided to just go get the binary. This spell is heading 
		  straight to z-rejected. 

2002-05-01  Eric Sandall <sandalle@yahoo.com>


		* Applied patches (except for gcc3 related) located at 
		  http://www.linux-debian.de/openoffice/, thanks to Yoav 
		  Avitzour <avitzour@princeton.edu> for pointing me here.

2002-03-06  Eric Sandall <sandalle@yahoo.com>

		* Modified DETAILS (finally figured this out ;) to have 
		  gpc as SOURCE2, rather than creating a whole other spell 
		  for 2 header files that just need to be copied for OpenOffice.

		* Found that if I have an "_" in my SOURCE (and probably any others), 
		  I must use the escape sequence "\" before it for it to read 
		  (e.g.  SOURCE=oo_$VERSION_src.tar.bz2 -> SOURCE=oo\_$VERSION\_src.tar.bz2)
