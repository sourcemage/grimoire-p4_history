gawk - Free version of awk
gawk performs simple data reformatting tasks, such as making changes in
various text files whenever certain patterns appear or extracting data
from parts of certain lines while discarding the rest, with just a few
lines of code. It provides several useful extensions not found in other
implementations. It is upwardly compatible with the latest POSIX
specification of awk.
