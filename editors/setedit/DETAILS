Setedit is a text editor specially designed for programmers. 
It has a nice interface with mouse support, menus and windows (text mode).
The editor is a very good choice for people with DOS background, especially
people accustomed to Worstar and Borland editors. The editor has overlapped
windows so you can see more than one file at the same time, configurable syntax
highlighting, macros, rectangular selection, block indentation, as well as
customizable keyboard shortcuts and menus
