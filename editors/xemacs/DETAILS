cat << EOF
XEmacs is a highly customizable open source text editor and application
development system. It is protected under the GNU Public License and
related to other versions of Emacs, in particular GNU Emacs. Its emphasis
is on modern graphical user interface support and an open software
development model, similar to Linux. XEmacs has an active development
community numbering in the hundreds, and runs on Windows 95 and NT, Linux
and nearly every other version of Unix in existence. Support for XEmacs
has been supplied by Sun Microsystems, University of Illinois, Lucid,
ETL/Electrotechnical Laboratory, Amdahl Corporation, BeOpen, and others,
as well as the unpaid time of a great number of individual developers.
