Jed is a powerful editor, terminal and X11 interface. Color syntax
highlighting is one of its strong suits, along with emulation of GNU
Emacs, Wordstar, EDT and Brief. It also supports use of GPM on Linux
consoles. Jed has a multitude of programming modes and couples with the
Slang library for powerful extensions.
