cat << EOF
As well as features found in standard text editing components, Scintilla includes 
features especially useful when editing and debugging source code. These include 
support for syntax styling, error indicators, code completion and call tips. The 
selection margin can contain markers like those used in debuggers to indicate 
breakpoints and the current line. Styling choices are more open than with many 
editors, allowing the use of proportional fonts, bold and italics, multiple 
foreground and background colours and multiple fonts.
