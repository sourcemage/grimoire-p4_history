Yzis a brand new editor inspired by vim.  Yzis aims to be a powerful, fast
editor with all of Vim's features and hopefully, at some point, more.

It is developed in C++ and relies on Qt for the some of the background
classes (lists and strings mainly).

In Yzis, the core editing functionality is placed in a library, and
interfaces are written on top of that.  As of now, there are frontends for
KDE and ncurses.  Especially the KDE-interface provides an easy-to-use
interface for users and allows you to have tabs for different buffers and a
GUI that allows you to change things like colour schemes and syntax
highlighting easily, while still letting (g)vim users feel at home.

By using the powerful scripting language Lua, you can also easily extend
yzis' functionality with scripts.

With an editing-engine clearly separated from the GUI, the different
interfaces can be written to be closely integrated in their respective
environments.  The KDE frontend, kyzis, can be seamlessly embedded in KDE
apps like Kdevelop.
