JOE has the feel of most IBM PC text editors: The key-sequences are
reminiscent of WordStar and Turbo-C. JOE is much more powerful than
those editors, however. JOE has all of the features a UNIX user
should expect: full use of termcap/terminfo, excellent screen update
optimizations, simple installation, and all of the UNIX-integration
features of VI.
