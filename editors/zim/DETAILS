Zim is a WYSIWYG text editor written in Gtk2-Perl. It aims at bringing the
concept of a wiki to your desktop. For example every page is saved as a text
file with wiki markup. Pages can contain links to other pages, and are saved
automatically. Creating a new page is as easy as linking to a non-existing
page. This tool is intended to keep track of TODO lists or serve as a personal
scratch book.
