e3 - a full-screen text editor written in assembler
e3 is a full-screen, user-friendly text editor with an interface
similar to that of either WordStar, Emacs, Pico, Nedit, or vi.
It's heavily optimized for size and independent of libc or any
other libraries, making it useful for mini-Linux distributions
and rescue disks. It is also possible to use regular expressions
by using child processes like sed. e3 has a built in arithmetic
calculator.
