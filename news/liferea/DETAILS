           SHORT="A simple FeedReader clone for Unix distributions with GTK2"
cat << EOF
Liferea is a simple FeedReader clone for Unix distributions with GTK2 (GNOME2
is optional). It is a news aggregator for RSS/RDF feeds which also supports CDF
channels, Atom/Echo/PIE feeds and OCS or OPML directories. The problem with
FeedReader: for now its only available for Windows. There are some projects for
GNU/Linux, but no solution for GTK/GNOME, which does not require Python or
Perl. Liferea tries to fill this gap. Liferea is an abbreviation for Linux Feed
Reader.
