Straw is a desktop news aggregator for the GNOME environment. Its aim is to be
a faster, easier and more accessible way to read news and blogs than the
traditional browser.

News aggregation?

News aggregators read news, weblog or other feeds over the web and aggregate
them so the news items are readable from a single place, regardless of their
source. The data format aggregators utilize to do their job is called RSS,
standing either for Really Simple Syndication or RDF Site Summary, depending on
who you ask. At the moment, there are two different, incompatible
specifications, with different objectives: RSS 0.9x/RSS 2.0 and RSS 1.0. Straw
supports both of them.
