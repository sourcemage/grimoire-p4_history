Leafnode is a USENET software package designed for small sites running any
flavour of Unix, with a few tens of readers and only a slow link to the net. It
was originally written by Arnt Gulbrandsen and is currently being maintained by
Cornelius Krasel <krasel@wpxx02.toxi.uni-wuerzburg.de>. 

The package consists of several programs:

* Leafnode is the NNTP server. It talks to the normal news clients, and
  stores readership data.
* Fetchnews is the program which gets news from upstream servers and sends 
  your posted articles to the upstream servers. 
  It also can find out which groups you read and gets articles accordingly.
* Fetch supports filtering incoming articles for regular expressions.
* Texpire is responsible for deleting old and uninteresting news.
  It deletes all discussion threads that are old and not recently
  read. 
* Applyfilter applies the contents of your filterfile to
  articles that you have already retrieved.
* Checkgroups inserts the titles of newsgroups into the
  newsgroup database.  
* Newsq shows which news are waiting
  to be transferred to your upstream server.
