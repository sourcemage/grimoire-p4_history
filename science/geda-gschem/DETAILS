gschem is the schematic capture program/tool which is part of gEDA. It's sole
purpose is to facilitate the graphical input of components/circuits.

Schematic capture is a fancy name for the ability to draw and layout circuits
using a computer. Standard symbols are used to represent the various gates and
components which are interconnected by nets (wires). Most vector drawing
programs can be used for schematic capture but they usually lack one (or more)
of the following characteristics:

* The awareness of the electrical properties of components, nets, and pins.
* Hierarchical design (having components represent some abstracted functionality).
* The ability to associate attributes with nets and components.
* Generate netlists from the schematic.
