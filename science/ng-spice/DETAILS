Ngspice is a mixed-level/mixed-signal circuit simulator based on three open 
source software packages: Spice3f5, Cider1b1 and Xspice.

Spice3 is the most famous and used circuit simulator.

Cider is mixed-level simulator that already includes Spice3f5 and adds a device
simulator to it: DSIM. Cider couples the circuit level simulator to the device 
simulator to provide greater simulation accuracy (at the expense of greater 
simulation time). Critical devices can be described with technology parameters 
(numerical models) and non critical ones with the original spice's compact 
models.

Xspice is an extension to Spice3 that provides code modeling support and 
simulation of digital components through an embedded event driven algorithm.

Ngspice is, anyway, a little more than the simple sum of the packages above, as 
many people contributed to the project with their experience, their bug fixes 
and their improvements. Ngspice is now an usable simulator: many of the original
bugs are fixed, it includes many recently developed compact models (BSIM3, 
BSIM4, SOI models, VBIC, HISIM, etc.) and some older models have been improved.
