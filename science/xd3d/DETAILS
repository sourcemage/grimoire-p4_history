xd3d is a simple scientific visualization tool designed to be easy to learn.
It can plot 2D and 3D meshes, with shadowing, contour plots, vector fields,
iso-contour (3D), as well as 3D surfaces z=f(x,y) defined by an algebraic
expression or a cloud of points. It generates high-quality vector PostScript
files for scientific publications and still or animated bitmap images. The 
distribution includes the graph plotter, xgraphic.
