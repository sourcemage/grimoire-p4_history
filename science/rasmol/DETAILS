RasMol is a molecular graphics program intended for the visualisation of proteins, 
nucleic acids and small molecules. The program is aimed at display, teaching and 
generation of publication quality images.  The program reads in a molecule coordinate 
file and interactively displays the molecule on the screen in a variety of colour 
schemes and molecule representations. Currently available representations include 
depth-cued wireframes, 'Dreiding' sticks, spacefilling (CPK) spheres, ball and stick, 
solid and strand biomolecular ribbons, atom labels and dot surfaces.  Up to 5 molecules 
may be loaded and displayed at once. Any one or all of the molecules may be rotated and 
translated.  The program reads in molecular coordinate files and interactively displays 
the molecule on the screen in a variety of representations and colour schemes. Supported 
input file formats include Protein Data Bank (PDB), Tripos Associates' Alchemy and Sybyl 
Mol2 formats, Molecular Design Limited's (MDL) Mol file format, Minnesota Supercomputer 
Center's (MSC) XYZ (XMol) format, CHARMm format, CIF format and mmCIF format files.
