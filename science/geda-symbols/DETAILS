Schematic symbols are an abstract representation of the physical components used
n electronic circuits. A physical component can be an intergated circuit (IC),
a passive device (like a resister), an active device (like a diode or
transistor), etc... Basically a symbol is the representation of the component on
a schematic sheet.

gEDA/gaf includes a symbol library of over 1400 symbols. The file format for the
symbols is in an easy to understand ASCII format and is the exact same file 
format as schematic files.
