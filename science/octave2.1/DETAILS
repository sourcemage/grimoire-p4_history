cat << EOF
This is the development version of Octave. It can co-exist with no problam 
with the stable version of octave (2.0.x).
GNU Octave is a high-level language, primarily intended for numerical 
computations. It provides a convenient command line interface for solving 
linear and nonlinear problems numerically, and for performing other numerical
experiments using a language that is mostly compatible with Matlab. It may 
also be used as a batch-oriented language.
