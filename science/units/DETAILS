The  units  program converts quantities expressed in various scales
to their equivalents in other scales.  The  units  program can handle
multiplicative scale changes as well as nonlinear conversions such
as Fahrenheit to Celsius.
The units are defined in an external data file.  You can use the
extensive data file that comes with this program, or you can provide
your own data file to suit your needs.
You can use the program interactively with prompts, or you can use it
from the command line.
