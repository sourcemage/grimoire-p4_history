Gwave is a tool I am writing using the Gtk+ toolkit. Its purpose is for viewing
analog data, such as the output of Spice simulations.

Gwave can read binary or ascii files written by HSpice from transient, AC, or 
Sweep analyses, transient analysis files from the CAzM simulator, and "out" 
format files from NanoSim. It can also read "raw" files from spice2G6, spice3F5
or ngspice, and a tabular ASCII format suitable for use with GnuCAP or 
homegrown tools.

It supports multiple "panels" (graticules) with multiple variables displayed in
each. Two vertical-bar cursors are available for time-difference measurements. 
Multiple files can be loaded, for comparing results of several simulations.
