cat << EOF
The gEDA project is working on producing a full GPL'd suite of Electronic Design
Automation tools. These tools are used for electrical circuit design, schematic
capture, simulation, prototyping, and production. Currently, the gEDA project
offers a mature suite of open-source applications for electronics design,
including schematic capture, attribute management, bill of materials (BOM)
generation, netlisting into over 20 netlist formats, analog and digital
simulation, and printed circuit board (PCB) layout.
