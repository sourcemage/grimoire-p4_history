SHORT="OpenGL-based chemistry simulation"
cat << EOF
GenChemLab is an OpenGL-based application intended to simulate 
several common general chemistry exercises. It is meant to be used to 
help students prepare for actual lab experience. It could also be 
used in cases where laboratory facilites are not accessible, for 
instance in K-12 schools or home schooling. 


At present, supported experiments include titration, calorimetry, 
freezing point depression, vapor pressure, and spectrophotometry.
