The Visualization ToolKit (VTK) is an open source, freely available software 
system for 3D computer graphics, image processing, and visualization. VTK 
consists of a C++ class library, and several interpreted interface layers 
including Tcl/Tk, Java, and Python. VTK supports a wide variety of visualization 
algorithms including scalar, vector, tensor, texture, and volumetric methods; 
and advanced modeling techniques such as implicit modelling, polygon reduction, 
mesh smoothing, cutting, contouring, and Delaunay triangulation. In addition,
dozens of imaging algorithms have been directly integrated to allow the user
to mix 2D imaging / 3D graphics algorithms and data. The design and 
implementation of the library has been strongly influenced by object-oriented 
principles.
