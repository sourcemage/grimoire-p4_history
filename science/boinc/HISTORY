	* DETAILS: Added PATCHLEVEL so people get the boinc init script (if they
	  haven't already) and so people with the current init script get the fixed
	  version (also so wxgtk-no-unicode gets marked as optional ;)).
	* DEPENDS: Made wxgtk-no-unicode optional (again...)
	  Added missing '&&' after first if/fi
	* init.d/boinc: Fixed missing quote
	  BOINC_PRAMS -> BOINC_PARMS
	  Removed unecessary '-r' in rm for PIDFILE

2006-03-26 David Brown <dmlb2000@gmail.com>
	* PRE_BUILD: added patch for loss of presision when type casting a void
	  pointer to an int
	* shmem-type-cast-presision-loss.patch: the loss of presision shows up
	  on x86-64 machines where a void pointer is different size from an int

2006-03-26 David Brown <dmlb2000@gmail.com>
	* DEPENDS: not elif but just plain if
	* BUILD: added program suffix to because /usr/bin/start
	  fscks up the init process

	* DEPENDS: Make wxgtk-no-unicode dependency optional
