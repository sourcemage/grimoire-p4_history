The gnetman project has one simple goal: Enabling interoperability between 
open-source EDA tools. To date, gnetman can read and/or write (in theory) 
formats used by the following tools:

* gschem -> .sch files -> gnetman
* iverilog <--> gate-level Verilog <--> gnetman
* gnetman <--> spice netlist -> ltspice or hspice or eldo or gnucap or tclspice
* confluence -> gate-level Verilog -> gnetman

Other formats that still need support to be developed in gnetman include:

* gate-level VHDL
* EDIF netlists

In addition, an automatic schematic generator from gnetman to gschem would be 
highly desirable.

Gnetman can be linked as a shared or static library into any open-source EDA 
tool. It also has a command-line version that takes TCL scripts and 
command-line arguments in order to translate file formats.
