Gnucap is the Gnu Circuit Analysis Package.

The primary component is a general purpose circuit simulator. It performs 
nonlinear dc and transient analyses, fourier analysis, and ac analysis. Spice 
compatible models for the MOSFET (level 1-7), BJT, and diode are included in 
this release.

Gnucap is not based on Spice, but some of the models have been derived from the
Berkeley models.

Unlike Spice, the engine is designed to do true mixed-mode simulation. Most of 
the code is in place for future support of event driven analog simulation, and 
true multi-rate simulation.

If you are tired of Spice and want a second opinion, you want to play with the 
circuit and want a simulator that is interactive, you want to study the source 
code and want something easier to follow than Spice, or you are a researcher 
working on modeling and want automated model generation tools to make your job 
easier, try Gnucap.
