gsymcheck is the symbol checker for the gEDA/gaf system. Give it a symbol file
and it will go through and verify that the symbol will work in gschem and
friends.

A sampling of the errors identified by gsymcheck:

    * Having invalid objects inside of a symbol
    * Missing certain required attributes
    * Duplication of certain attributes
    * Incorrect usage of the various attribute
    * Using forbidden, obsolete, or invalid attributes

gsymcheck does not verify graphical properties of symbols yet.

All users wishing to submitting symbols should run gsymcheck and correct all
warnings and errors before submitting the symbols. Thank you.
