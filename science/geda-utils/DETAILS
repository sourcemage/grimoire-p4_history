Currently there are several utilities:

Program name: gmk_sym
Written by: Jerry O'Keefe
gmk_sym is a simple utility to convert comma separated descriptions into
rectangular gschem symbols. It should be useful for easily creating memory,
processors or connector style parts.

Program name: smash_megafile
Written by: Mike Jarabek
smash_megafile is a C program that will take a ViewLogic megafile and extract
the contents into a directory of the same name, with one file representing each
element in the library.

Program name: convert_sym
Written by: Mike Jarabek
convert_sym takes ViewLogic Viewdraw schematic or symbol and outputs a gschem
compatible file. This utility should be considered a work in progress. Be
warned, this program has quite a few limitations. See the README file in the
utils/ directory for more info. This program is written in C. There is also an
awk version which is old and no longer supported, however it is included in the
distribution as reference.

Program name: Sarlacc
Written by: Matthew Ettus
Sarlacc is an OrCAD to gEDA format schematic converter. This software is beta,
so it still has limitations.

Program name: gpstoimage
Written by: Ales Hvezda
A simple bourne shell script which shows how to take the postscript generated by
gschem and convert it into an image (such as a gif or whatever).
