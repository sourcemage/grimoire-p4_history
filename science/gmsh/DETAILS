Gmsh is an automatic 3D finite element grid generator (primarily Delaunay) 
with a build-in CAD engine and post-processor. Its design goal is to provide 
a simple meshing tool for academic problems with parametric input and advanced 
visualization capabilities.

Gmsh is built around four modules: geometry, mesh, solver and post-processing. 
The specification of any input to these modules is done either interactively 
using the graphical user interface or in ASCII text files using Gmsh's own 
scripting language.
