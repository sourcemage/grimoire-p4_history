PhyloGrapher is a program designed to visualize and study evolutionary relationships within families of homologous genes or proteins (elements). PhyloGrapher is a drawing tool that generates custom graphs for the given set of elements. In general, it is possible to use PhyloGrapher to visualize any type of relations between elements.

Each gene or protein on the PhyloGrapher's graph is represented as a colored node (vertex) and connected to other nodes (vertices) by lines (edges) of variable thickness and color based on the similarity of genes or proteins (distance matrix). The position of each node in the graph is flexible and adjusted by the user to optimize visualization of the inter-relationships between the nodes. Consequently, the physical distances on the graph between nodes have no information content unlike classical phylogenetic trees. The level of similarity between genes or proteins on PhyloGrapher's graphs is indicated by color and line thickness.
