cat << EOF
CMUCL is a free implementation of the Common Lisp programming language
which runs on most major Unix platforms. It mainly conforms to the ANSI
Common Lisp standard. Here is a summary of its main features:

     a sophisticated native-code compiler which is capable
     of powerful type inferences, and generates code competitive in speed
     with C compilers.

     generational garbage collection and multiprocessing
     capability on the x86 ports.

     a foreign function interface which allows interfacing with C code and
     system libraries, including shared libraries on most platforms, and
     direct access to Unix system calls.

     support for interprocess communication and remote procedure
     calls.

     an implementation of CLOS, the Common Lisp Object System, which
     includes multimethods and a metaobject protocol.
     
     a graphical source-level debugger using a Motif interface, and a
     code profiler.

     an interface to the X11 Window System (CLX), and a sophisticated
     graphical widget library (Garnet).

     programmer-extensible input and output streams.

     an Emacs-like editor implemented in Common Lisp.

     public domain: free, with full source code and no
     strings attached (and no warranty). Like the GNU/ Linux and *BSD
     operating systems, CMUCL is maintained and improved by a team of
     volunteers collaborating over the Internet.
