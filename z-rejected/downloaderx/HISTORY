                Changed PRE_BUILD so that it does not just
                exit by default, now it will execute if you
                answer yes to the questions (thanks Yoav).

		Added HISTORY file. Spell rejected as it really
		bogs down a site by creating many connections
		blocking other users. Not really user friendly!
