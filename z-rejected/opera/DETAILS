cat << EOF
Opera is a fast full featured web browser. It supports plugins and is very customizable. It uses the qt2 widget set. The static version is included here because the current grimoire uses qt3 which is not backwards compatible. Opera is unfortunatly not open source and thus destined to be placed in the rejected section of the grimoire.
