This _was_ the truetype spell, but due to Microsoft's pig-headed refusal to
understand the meaning of the word "free"... a completely different file now
has to be downloaded. The original file, originally available from Microsoft,
then available from http://www.keithp.com/~keithp/fonts/ now only includes
Windows executables.

Please note that this spell should now be placed in the "z-rejected" area,
as these fonts aren't "free".
	
Install these high quality TrueType fonts, and whenever you visit a Web site
that specifies them, you'll see pages exactly as the site designer intended.
