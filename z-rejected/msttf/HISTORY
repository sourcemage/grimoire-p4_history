        this _was_ the truetype spell, but due to Microsoft's
	pig-headed refusal to understand the meaning of the 
	word "free"... a completely different file now has to 
	be downloaded. The original file, available from
	http://www.keithp.com/~keithp/fonts/
	now only includes Windows executables.
	Please note that this spell should now be placed in
	the "z-rejected" area, as these fonts aren't "free".
