		Modified DETAILS to correct MD5

2003-01-29  Tony Smith <tony@smee.org>

		Reverted to 2002.1 due to glibc 2.3 compatibility issues
		with the current 2002.2 Linux builds.

2003-01-06  Tony Smith <tony@smee.org>

		Updated to new release 2002.2
		Fixed typo that was causing p4web not to download properly
		Remove source cache files after build because the filenames
		don't contain the version so they were being erroneously
		re-used.

2002-10-02  Tony Smith <tony@smee.org>
		Changed spell to use the Linux 2.4 builds as it is now one
		of Perforce's primary build platforms. Also updated version
		to include the build number so we can grab patch releases
		easily.
