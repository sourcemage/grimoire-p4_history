		Updated to new release 2002.2.
		Also made it delete the source cached p4d file as sorcery
		wants to re-use it because the filename does not contain the
		version number. Better to download again than use the wrong
		file.

		Changed to use Linux 2.4 build as this is now a primary build
		platform for Perforce. Also updated version to include the
		build number so we can grab patch builds easily.
