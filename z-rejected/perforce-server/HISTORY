2003-03-31  Eric Sandall <eric@sandall.us>

		Updated to use sorcery's init.d installer

		Updated PRE_REMOVE to only run the script
		if it's executable

2003-02-27  Seth Woolley <seth@tautology.org>

		Fixed MD5 (will fix PRE_BUILD later)

2003-02-12  Tony Smith <tony@smee.org>

		Back up to 2002.2 now that new fixed builds have been
		posted.

2003-01-30  Seth Woolley <seth@tautology.org>

		Modified DETAILS to correct MD5

2003-01-29  Tony Smith <tony@smee.org>
		Reverted to 2002.1 as there are problems with glibc 2.3
		compatibility at the moment due to build changes.

2003-01-06  Tony Smith <tony@smee.org>

		Updated to new release 2002.2.
		Also made it delete the source cached p4d file as sorcery
		wants to re-use it because the filename does not contain the
		version number. Better to download again than use the wrong
		file.

2002-10-02  Tony Smith <tony@smee.org>

		Changed to use Linux 2.4 build as this is now a primary build
		platform for Perforce. Also updated version to include the
		build number so we can grab patch builds easily.

2002-09-14  Geoffrey Derber <gderber@sourcemage.org>

		Added MD5/license/maintainer fields.

2002-09-07  Geoffrey Derber <gderber@sourcemage.org>

		Changed PRE_BUILD file

2002-05-14  Tony Smith <tony@smee.org>

                First version
