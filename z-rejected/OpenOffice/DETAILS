OpenOffice.org is the open source project through which Sun
         Microsystemshas released the technology for the popular
         StarOffice[tm] Productivity Suite. All of the StarOffice
         source code is available under the GNU Lesser General Public
         License (LGPL) as well as the Sun Industry Standards Source
         License (SISSL). Sun is participating as a member of the
         OpenOffice.org community. OpenOffice.org is being hosted by
         CollabNet. 

The suite includes:
scalc    -  A spreadsheet application
sdraw    -  A vector drawing program
simpress -  A presentation program
smath    -  An equation editor
sweb     -  A WYSIWIG web page editor
swriter  -  A word processor

Note:
After installing, attempting to run any of the applications will run a
graphical installation for a single user. Each user must do this, so
select "net install" to minimise disk usage.
