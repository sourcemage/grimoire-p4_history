		Completely rewrote the spell to use sorcery's
		cvs downloading, and tarring.

		Removed DEPENDS because having a 'depends cvs' was
		only necissary when the spell required cvs for
		downloading.  It was done to ensure that people
		could download winex, since sorcery does this, and
		sorcery depends one cvs, this is redundancy.

		Realized HISTORY File was missing.
		Fixed a PRE_BUILD bug.
		Updated the VERSION field to force a rebuild
		so that it references the updated glibc.
