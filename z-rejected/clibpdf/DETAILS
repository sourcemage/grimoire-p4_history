cat << EOF
ClibPDF is a library of ANSI C functions, distributed as source code, for 
creating PDF (Acrobat) files directly via C language programs without relying 
on any Adobe Acrobat tools and related products.  It is free for private, 
non-profit use, but a commercial license is required for for-profit 
applications.
