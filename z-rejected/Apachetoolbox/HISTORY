		Changed PRE_BUILD so that it does not just
		exit by default, now it will execute if you
		answer yes to the questions (thanks Yoav).

		Added HISTORY file. The reason for rejection
		is that this spell can install many apache
		modules that will no longer be tracked by
		sorcery (alien). It does work fine!
