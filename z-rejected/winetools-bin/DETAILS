 Wine Tools is a collection of tools for Wine.

* Install an application
You can choose a setup program which will be run with Wine. There is also an option to install DCOM98, this is needed to make some Installshield installers (as used by Dreamweaver, Flash, etc) work.

* Uninstall an application
Every application that creates a registry entry and has an uninstall function can be uninstalled (does not work for uninstallers which use rundll32.exe).

* Create a fake Windows drive
Create a Windows directory structure with registry and configuration file in $HOME/.wine

* Edit the Wine config
There is an builtin editor to edit the config file.

* Add a .reg file

* Install a MS webfont (such as Arial, Geneva, Times New Roman, etc.)
