		Major bug fixes.  Still not perfect, but now
		the spell updates the version date after the
		website updates, which while not quite at the
		time as the website which would be optimal, is
		still better than it as it was, which often
		happened prior to the website update.

		Note: It seems that sometimes the nightlies
		are not updated on the gaim website when they
		should.  There is nothing I can do about this.
