		Added init script using sorcery's init.d installer

		Now asks if you want to reconfigure, so it no longer
		stops installs

		If no SPELL_CONFIG is found, defaults to i386

		Added PRE_REMOVE and POST_INSTALL for starting scripts

		Fixed Bug #2031

		Modified setiathome and xsetiathome to pass any variables
		sent to them to the actual binaries

		Now only tries to install xsetiathome if it is included in
		the package, as some (SPARC) do not have an xsetiathome
