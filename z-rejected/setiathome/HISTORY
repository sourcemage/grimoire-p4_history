		Added information about joining the Source
		Mage SETI@Home team.  :)

		Added init script using sorcery's init.d installer

		Now asks if you want to reconfigure, so it no longer
		stops installs

		If you SPELL_CONFIG is found, defaults to i386

		Fixed Bug #2031

		Modified setiathome and xsetiathome to pass any variables
		sent to them to the actual binaries

		Now only tries to install xsetiathome if it is included in
		the package, as some (SPARC) do not have an xsetiathome

		Created spell
