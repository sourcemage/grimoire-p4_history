Asterisk is a hybrid TDM and packet voice PBX (Private Branch eXchange) 
and IVR platform with ACD functionality. It acts as middleware between 
the Internet (IAX, SIP, MGCP, Skinny, H.323), telephony channels (like 
Zaptel, T1, PRI, E1, FXO, FXS, VoIP, VoFR, ISDN, modems, Internet Phone 
Jack, etc.), and applications (like voice-mail, conferencing, directories, 
MP3 players, intercoms, etc.). It has many advanced features such as a 
codec translation API. The base distribution includes several channel backends, 
as well as applications. However, the beauty of Asterisk is its ability to be 
extended using its APIs, dynamic module loader, and AGI scripting interface. 
End users can even write their own applications that run on the system in 
C or any scripting language of their choice.
