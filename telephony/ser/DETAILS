SIP Express Router (ser) is a high-performance, configurable, free SIP (RFC3261)
server . It can act as SIP registrar, proxy or redirect server. SER features an 
application-server interface, presence support, SMS gateway, SIMPLE2Jabber 
gateway, RADIUS/syslog accounting and authorization, server status monitoring, FCP 
security, etc. Web-based user provisioning, serweb, available.

Its performance allows it to deal with operational burdens, such as broken network

small-office use, enterprise PBX replacements and carrier services.
