These sounds were recorded in March of 2003 by Allison Smith, who does PBX
voicemail voices for hire and is the voice of Asterisk. She does a great job!
I gave her a list of words and phrases, and quickly she had sent me back a
continuous file of what I needed.  I cut the file up into pieces, and some of
them are in this directory for your use.
Note: she did not, in fact, make the monkey noises.
