		Update md5 info.

2002-07-03  Eric Schabell <eric@schabell.com>

                Added sorcery config file to set of copied files
                that are installed in BUILD file, this to prevent 
                a sorcery update from erasing the installed grimoire:
                for example, you switch to test grimoire from a devel grimoire,
                and if you do a sorcery update the config file must not point 
                to devel grimoire... that is fixed now! 
                Also removed SOURCE[0] lines to avoid problems.

		Small update to DETAILS desc.

2002-05-15  Eric Schabell <eric@schabell.com>

                Update URL's to reflect codex site
                as primary and added perforce as 4th site.
                Also updated website to sourcemage.org

		Corrected BUILD file to dispel all existing
                sections and added two lines to dispel all kinds
                of older sections that might be still lurking on
                older machines, they cause no problems if not on
                the machine.

		Create spell for updating only the grimoire 
		without doing a sorcery update. 
		This version updates to the stable grimoire. Added 
		grimoire-only-stable to the /var/lib/sorcery/sustained
		list to prevent dispelling.
