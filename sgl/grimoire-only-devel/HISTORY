                Update URL's to reflect codex site
                as primary and added perforce as 4th site.
                Also updated website to sourcemage.org

                Corrected BUILD file to dispel all existing
                sections and added two lines to dispel all kinds
                of older sections that might be still lurking on
                older machines, they cause no problems if not on
                the machine.

		Added 3rd source url to point for fallbacks
		to perforce server. At this point the devel 
		grimoire is generated w/o my personal scripts 
		on my PC and propogates to source url's 0 and 1
		every hour.

		Moved spell to grimoire-only-devel.

		Removed optional dep "compiler cache", only needed
		for sorcery (thanks to Treeve Jelbert).

2002-03-28  Eric Schabell <eric@schabell.com>

		Create spell for updating only the grimoire 
		without doing a sorcery update. Added 
		grimoire-only to the /var/lib/sorcery/sustained
		list to prevent dispelling.
