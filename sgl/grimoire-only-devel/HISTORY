		Added 3rd source url to point for fallbacks
		to perforce server. At this point the devel 
		grimoire is generated w/o my personal scripts 
		on my PC and propogates to source url's 0 and 1
		every hour.

		Removed optional dep "compiler cache", only needed
		for sorcery (thanks to Treeve Jelbert).

		Create spell for updating only the grimoire 
		without doing a sorcery update. Added 
		grimoire-only to the /var/lib/sorcery/sustained
		list to prevent dispelling.
