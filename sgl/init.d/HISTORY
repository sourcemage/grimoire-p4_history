		Added Nealbirch's init.d scripts, but just so they're here, ready to be used.  Nothing is done with them as of yet.  :)
		Removed functions.bz2 (I thought I did this already...)
		Modified BUILD to check for each symlink, at WaRL0CK's, Oadae's, and toomanymirrors' suggestion.  Fixes the mounting problems everyone has been having, though I still don't know where the problem came from.  Oadae suggested it happened from the transition for e2fsprogs->init.d and the changes which kept happening, and this might be correct.  Anyways, symlinks will now be (re)created if they don't exist.

		Uncompressed functions.bz2 and mount.sh.bz2
		Made BUILD simpler, for now

2002-09-09  Eric Sandall <eric@sandall.us>
		Added 'true' to POST_INSTALL and PRE_BUILD
		Moved mount.sh from e2fsprogs to init.d (Bug #914)
		Revised BUILD to track (via 'install') the files installed

		This spell adds /etc/init.d/functions for general use init functions and variables
		Will go into a basesystem-type spell once we get that worked out
