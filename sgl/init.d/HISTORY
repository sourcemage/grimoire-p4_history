		Uncompressed functions.bz2 and mount.sh.bz2
		Made BUILD simpler, for now

2002-09-09  Eric Sandall <eric@sandall.us>
		Added 'true' to POST_INSTALL and PRE_BUILD
		Moved mount.sh from e2fsprogs to init.d (Bug #914)
		Revised BUILD to track (via 'install') the files installed

		This spell adds /etc/init.d/functions for general use init functions and variables
		Will go into a basesystem-type spell once we get that worked out
