Grimoire test updated only  -  

	Spells have to maintain a stable state in devel grimoire for two weeks
	before they make it into the test grimoire. The only exception is URL
	changes which move through all grimoires immediatly.

	This is the testing grimoire, where spells are moved between 
	devel and stable for a quality check, please report problems.
	Most up to date spell book, maintained by Tony Smith.
	Installed into /var/lib/sorcery/grimoire
