		Fixed bug #127, removed dispel of grimoire sections
		as only sorcery should be installed.

2002-05-15  Eric Schabell <eric@schabell.com>

		Update URL's to reflect codex site
		as primary and added perforce as 4th site.
		Also updated website to sourcemage.org

                Corrected BUILD file to dispel all existing
                sections and added two lines to dispel all kinds
                of older sections that might be still lurking on
                older machines, they cause no problems if not on
                the machine.

		Added this History file, my name to MAINTAINER
		line, created this spell to update sorcery w/o
		updating the grimoire and added this spell to the
		/var/lib/sorcery/sustained to prevent user dispelling.
