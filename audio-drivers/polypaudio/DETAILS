polypaudio is a sound server for Linux and other Unix like operating systems.
It is intended to be an improved drop-in replacement for the Enlightened Sound
Daemon (ESOUND). In addition to the features ESOUND provides polypaudio has:

* Extensible plugin architecture (by loading dynamic loadable modules with
  dlopen())
* Support for more than one sink/source
* Better low latency behaviour
* Embedabble into other software (the core is available as C library)
* Completely asynchronous C API
* Simple command line interface for reconfiguring the daemon while running
* Flexible, implicit sample type conversion and resampling
* "Zero-Copy" architecture
* Module autoloading
* Very accurate latency measurement for playback and recordin.
* May be used to combine multiple sound cards to one (with sample rate
  adjustment)
* Client side latency interpolation
