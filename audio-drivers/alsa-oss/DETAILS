From http://www.alsa-project.org/intro.php3
The Advanced Linux Sound Architecture project is being developed in the Linux operating system and is released under version 2 of the GPL (GNU general public license) and the LGPL (GNU library general public license).
Primary goals: 
1. Create a fully modularized sound driver which supports kerneld and kmod.
2. Create the ALSA Kernel API which surpasses the current OSS API.
3. Maintain compatibility with most OSS/Lite binaries.
4. Create the ALSA Library (C, C++), which simplifies ALSA application development.
5. Create the ALSA Manager, an interactive configuration program for the driver.

This spell installs the preferred meathod of using the OSS compatiblity layer (according to the Alsa development site.  It includes a script called 'aoss' that acts as a wrapper for programs to utilise the OSS compatabliity layer without having to have the modules loaded.
