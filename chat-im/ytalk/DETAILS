YTalk is multi-user talk program, that is compatible with the older
Unix talk clients and daemons. It lets you communicate interactively
with other people on the internet.

When using YTalk, the screen is split into two or more regions or
windows, one for each person with whom you are talking. Each key you
type appears on your region, and on the screens of each other user
in the conversation. Each key typed by another user appears in that
user's region.
