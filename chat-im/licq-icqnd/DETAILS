A GTK2-gui for Licq. This GPLed project is the approach to provide a 
good gtk2 interface to the popular licq program. There were other efforts, but they are discontinued or just outdated. The reason for creating this plugin is, regarding the original qt-gui for licq, on the one hand a question of the integration of the user interface. In my eyes the qt-gui lacks a certain usability and good look in some points, also it does not really integrate with gtk desktops.
