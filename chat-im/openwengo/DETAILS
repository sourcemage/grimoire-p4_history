WengoPhone is a multi-platform VOIP client sponsored and developed by
WENGO and MBDSYS. The GUI part is Qt-based, and the Video-over-IP engine is
based on the eXosip, oSIP, oRTP, and ffmpeg projects. The eXosip module is
extended by a phApi module, which implements a high-level, easy-to-use call
control API. WengoPhone supports PC-to-PC voice, video, and chat. One can
use a standard SIP service provider such as Wengo to be assigned an incoming
number, make calls to PSTN/cell phones, get voice mail, and more.
