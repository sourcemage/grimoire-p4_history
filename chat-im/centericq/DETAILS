centericq is a text mode menu- and window-driven IM interface.
ICQ2000, Yahoo and MSN protocols are now supported. It allows you 
to send, receive, and forward messages, URLs, SMSes and,
contacts, mass message send, search for users (including extended
"whitepages search"), view users' details, maintain your contact
list directly from the program (including non-icq contacts), view 
the messages history, register a new UIN and update your details,
be informed on receiving email messages, automatically set away
after the defined period of inactivity (on any console), and have
your own ignore, visible and invisible lists. It can also
associate events with sounds, has support for Hebrew and Arabic
languages and allows to arrange contacts into groups.
