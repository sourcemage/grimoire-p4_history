cat << EOF
EB-lite is the name of the rewrite that is being developed of the instant
 messaging client Everybuddy.  It carries many major advances on the
 current codebase, the biggest of which is that the user interface is
 not contained in the same process as the core.  Currently only stable 
UI is ebqt.
