cat << EOF
GTKtalog is a tool to make disk catalog: you can use it to create a really small database with 
images of files and directories of your CDs.
Then you can browse all your CDs very quickly, see contents of some files (tar.gz, rpm files ...).
You can assign a category and a description to each directory and/or file.
You can search files in your database using filename, category, description and/or file information 
parameters, and find in which CD the file you are looking for is.
