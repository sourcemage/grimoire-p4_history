Install this package only after you have created, and tested, a rescue disk using the 'mkrescue' command.  Failure to do so could result in your system becoming unbootable if something goes wrong during installation.  You have been warned.

GNU GRUB is a Multiboot boot loader. It was derived from GRUB, GRand Unified Bootloader, which was originally designed and implemented by Erich Stefan Boleyn.  Spell originally submitted by ashaman@flyingtemple.com, radically altered by jean@kcco.com to add autodetection of some partitions and protections against accidentally making your system unbootable.
