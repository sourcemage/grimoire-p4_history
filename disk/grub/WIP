Need to figure out how to get the query in FINAL visable without using VOYEUR="on" globally -> still true now ??

Need to get reiser4 compatible with diskless operation and graphics support

Need to determine if grub-0.96 is enough functionnal with graphics or reiser4 support (still exclusive :'( ) to go into test
