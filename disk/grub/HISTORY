  * initial review and testing of grub spell for inclusion in grimoire
  * added LICENSE[0] information to DETAILS file
  * fixed installation procedure to include copying needed files from
    /usr/share/grub/i386-pc/*stage* to /boot/grub.
  * fixed installation procedure to put grub in /sbin, not /usr/sbin,
    to insure it works on those systems that mount /usr separately
  ! Work is still needed to make a sensible default menu.lst entry
    based on the system's own hardware, in a POSTINSTALL script.
  ! Work is still needed to make a sensible interface to lilo and grub
    to allow installation and kernel spells to install/update grub
    appropriately
  * added HISTORY file
