  		* added all kinds of warnings to users to have a working rescue diskette
    		  handy before attempting to install grub.  If and when grub becomes a
 	   	  standard part of the install I'll tone down the messages some.
  		* moved cp of /usr/share/grub/i386-pc/*stage* from BUILD to POST_INSTALL
	    	  This corrects a serious bug during upgrades which causes stage1_5 and
    		  stage2 files to get dispelled, making the system unbootable until the
    		  next time grub is run and setup again.
  		* added some intelligence to the POST_INSTALL script to facilitate 
    		  easier installation and recovery from the above, corrected bug.
  		* added CONFIGURE file to facilitate configuration of some parameters.
    		  Note that GRUB_ROOT is configured during POST_INSTALL, as the autodetection
    		  scheme requires grub already be installed.

  		* initial review and testing of grub spell for inclusion in grimoire
	  	* added	 LICENSE[0] information to DETAILS file
  		* fixed installation procedure to include copying needed files from
    		  /usr/share/grub/i386-pc/*stage* to /boot/grub.
  		* fixed installation procedure to put grub in /sbin, not /usr/sbin,
    		  to insure it works on those systems that mount /usr separately
  		! Work is still needed to make a sensible default menu.lst entry
     		  based on the system's own hardware, in a POSTINSTALL script.
  		! Work is still needed to make a sensible interface to lilo and grub
    		  to allow installation and kernel spells to install/update grub
    		  appropriately
  		* added HISTORY file

  		* Initial submission of grub spell to SGL-Spell-Submit
  		* Listed MAINTAINER as ashaman@flyingtemple.com ... not sure why this is.
