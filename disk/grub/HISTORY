2003-09-01 Geoffrey Derber <gderber@sourcemag.org>
	* Thanks to a huge patch from Debian
	  we finally have the grub splashimage
	  working.

2003-08-30 Geoffrey Derber <gderber@sourcemage.org>
	* Updated POST_BUILD to add make it easier for
	  the kernel spell to update the grub.conf file.
	* Added tons of options to CONFIGURE (too many?)
	* modified BUILD to chmod 750 /sbin/grub* so
	  normal users can not run the apps

2003-06-16 Eric Sandall <eric@sandall.us>
	* Added gcc 3.3 patch (thanks to Wolfgang)

	  (ashaman@flyingtemple.com), along with all the
	  patches
	* Formatted HISTORY to follow SMGL Standards

2002-08-06 Eric Sandall <sandalle@hellhound.homeip.net>
	* Edited ./configure to use -falign-* instead of -malign (obsoleted in gcc3)

2002-07-24 Eric Sandall <sandalle@yahoo.com>
	* Added another mirror for alpha.gnu.org thanks to the guys on #hurd

2002-07-14 Eric Sandall <sandalle@yahoo.com>
	* Added another mirror (thanks to ShdwDrgn) since alpha.gnu.org is down

2002-06-16 Eric Sandall <sandalle@yahoo.com>
	* Changed "Sorcerer" to "Source Mage" in POST_INSTALL
	* Made "lba32" default on
	* Moved the entries on the default kernel to new lines

2002-06-14 Eric Sandall <sandalle@yahoo.com>
	* Added MD5 entry to DETAILS

2002-05-29 Eric Sandall <sandalle@yahoo.com>
	* Tested and works with gcc3

2002-05-20 Eric Sandall <sandalle@yahoo.com>
	* Added conflict for LILO

2002-04-30 Geoffrey Derber <ashaman@flyingtemple.com>
	* Version updated to 0.92. md5crypt now works.

2002-04-25 Eric Schabell <eric@schabell.com>
	* Changed maintainer to Goeffrey Derber, due to leaving of Jean-Michel.

2002-03-26 Jean-Michel Smith <jean@kcco.com>
	* added all kinds of warnings to users to have a working rescue diskette
	  handy before attempting to install grub. If and when grub becomes a
	  standard part of the install I'll tone down the messages some.
	* moved cp of /usr/share/grub/i386-pc/*stage* from BUILD to POST_INSTALL
	  This corrects a serious bug during upgrades which causes stage1_5 and
	  stage2 files to get dispelled, making the system unbootable until the
	  next time grub is run and setup again.
	* added some intelligence to the POST_INSTALL script to facilitate 
	  easier installation and recovery from the above, corrected bug.
	* added CONFIGURE file to facilitate configuration of some parameters.
	  Note that GRUB_ROOT is configured during POST_INSTALL, as the 
	  autodetection scheme requires grub already be installed.

2002-03-25 Jean-Michel Smith <jean@kcco.com>
	* initial review and testing of grub spell for inclusion in grimoire
	* added LICENSE[0] information to DETAILS file
	* fixed installation procedure to include copying needed files from
	  /usr/share/grub/i386-pc/*stage* to /boot/grub.
	* fixed installation procedure to put grub in /sbin, not /usr/sbin,
	  to insure it works on those systems that mount /usr separately
	* Work is still needed to make a sensible default menu.lst entry
	  based on the system's own hardware, in a POSTINSTALL script.
	* Work is still needed to make a sensible interface to lilo and grub
	  to allow installation and kernel spells to install/update grub
	  appropriately
	* added HISTORY file

2002-03-24 Geoffrey Derber <Geoffrey.Derber@Trinity.edu>
	* Initial submission of grub spell to SGL-Spell-Submit
	* Listed MAINTAINER as ashaman@flyingtemple.com ... not sure why this is.
