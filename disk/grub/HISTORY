		added all kinds of warnings to users to have a working rescue diskette
		handy before attempting to install grub.  If and when grub becomes a
		standard part of the install I'll tone down the messages some.

		moved cp of /usr/share/grub/i386-pc/*stage* from BUILD to POST_INSTALL
		This corrects a serious bug during upgrades which causes stage1_5 and
		stage2 files to get dispelled, making the system unbootable until the
		next time grub is run and setup again.

		added some intelligence to the POST_INSTALL script to facilitate 
		easier installation and recovery from the above, corrected bug.

		added CONFIGURE file to facilitate configuration of some parameters.
		Note that GRUB_ROOT is configured during POST_INSTALL, as the 
		autodetection scheme requires grub already be installed.

2002-03-25  Jean-Michel Smith <jean@kcco.com>

		initial review and testing of grub spell for inclusion in grimoire

		added	 LICENSE[0] information to DETAILS file

		fixed installation procedure to include copying needed files from
		/usr/share/grub/i386-pc/*stage* to /boot/grub.

		fixed installation procedure to put grub in /sbin, not /usr/sbin,
		to insure it works on those systems that mount /usr separately

		Work is still needed to make a sensible default menu.lst entry
		based on the system's own hardware, in a POSTINSTALL script.

		Work is still needed to make a sensible interface to lilo and grub
		to allow installation and kernel spells to install/update grub
		appropriately

		added HISTORY file

2002-03-24  Geoffrey Derber <Geoffrey.Derber@Trinity.edu>
