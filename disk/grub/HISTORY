2002-03-26 Jean-Michel Smith <jean@kcco.com>
	* added all kinds of warnings to users to have a working rescue diskette
	handy before attempting to install grub.  If and when grub becomes a
	standard part of the install I'll tone down the messages some.
	moved cp of /usr/share/grub/i386-pc/*stage* from BUILD to POST_INSTALL
	* This corrects a serious bug during upgrades which causes stage1_5 and
	stage2 files to get dispelled, making the system unbootable until the
	next time grub is run and setup again.
	* POST_INSTALL: added some intelligence to to facilitate 
	easier installation and recovery from the above, corrected bug.
	* CONFIGURE: Added to facilitate configuration of some parameters.
	* Note that GRUB_ROOT is configured during POST_INSTALL, as the 
	autodetection scheme requires grub already be installed.

	* initial review and testing of grub spell for inclusion in grimoire
	* DETAILS: added LICENSE[0] information
	* fixed installation procedure to include copying needed files from
	/usr/share/grub/i386-pc/*stage* to /boot/grub.
	* fixed installation procedure to put grub in /sbin, not /usr/sbin,
	to insure it works on those systems that mount /usr separately
	* Work is still needed to make a sensible default menu.lst entry
	based on the system's own hardware, in a POSTINSTALL script.
	Work is still needed to make a sensible interface to lilo and grub
	to allow installation and kernel spells to install/update grub
	appropriately
	* HISTORY: Added
