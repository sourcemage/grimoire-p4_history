  * added 'provides' which was erroneously excluded, thanks "Gabriel Devenyi" 
    <ace118@hotmail.com> for identifying the problem.

  * changed spell name to cdrutils to facilitate coexistence with dvdrtools
    (both provide 'cdrtools') without requiring changes to those spells which
    depend upon cdrtools.
  * added 'provides' cd-burn-utility

  * removed zisofs dependency per request, as it had broken the entire
    cdrtools spell.  This will also facilitate adding dvdrtools to the
    grimoire.

  * added LICENSE[0] information to DETAILS file
