		Removed 'provides' which was erroneously included (and created a
		circular dependency), thanks "Gabriel Devenyi" <ace118@hotmail.com>
		for identifying this.

		Initial creation of the cdrtools metaspell, after renaming the old
		cdrtools spell 'cdrutils'.  This is designed to facilitate a relatively
		seemless substitution, so that spells that depend on cdrtools can
		use either the new FSF dvdrtools fork, or the original fork, without
		any modification of those spells.  Examples include gcombust and eroaster.
