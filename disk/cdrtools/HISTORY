  * initial creation of the cdrtools metaspell, after renaming the old
    cdrtools spell 'cdrutils'.  This is designed to facilitate a relatively
    seemless substitution, so that spells that depend on cdrtools can
    use either the new FSF dvdrtools fork, or the original fork, without
    any modification of those spells.  Examples include gcombust and eroaster.
