0.4.5 does not work for now. There seems to have a bug with unsermake (now needed to compile).

Here is the output :

creating ./src/qp_ui_config.cpp
/bin/sh: -c: line 0: syntax error near unexpected token `then'
/bin/sh: -c: line 0: `/usr/lib/qt/bin/uic -L -nounload -i qp_ui_config.h /home/giancarlo/Download/qtparted-0.4.5/src/qp_ui_config.ui > ./src/qp_ui_config.cpp ; ret=$? if test "$ret" = 0; then echo '#include "qp_ui_config.moc"' >> ./src/qp_ui_config.cpp; else rm -f ./src/qp_ui_config.cpp; exit $ret; fi'
Error creating ./src/qp_ui_config.cpp. Exit status 2.

------

And there is a lot of lines like that. I don't see how to correct this now. On [0] authors proposes to type compiling lines by hand... :'(

I will probably wait for the next release.
