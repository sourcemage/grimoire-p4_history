cat << EOF
Part of grsecurity utils.
Basically what gtrace does is allow you to automatically create ACLs
for any binary or running process on your system, without having to have
any knowledge of how capabilities work or what permissions a program needs
to have on a certain file or how to interpret strace output 
(which can be a long, tedious process)  What it does code-wise is hook
up a process pipe to strace and parse the output.
Note that for the output ACL to appear, the process has to exit.
