dvdrtools is a fork of cdrtools, with the primary goal of supporting writable DVD drives.  People have successfully used dvdrtools to burn video DVDs (with the masters created using other software) and data DVDs.  The Pioneer DVR-A03 is well supported, other MMC compliant compliant hardware is likely to work.
