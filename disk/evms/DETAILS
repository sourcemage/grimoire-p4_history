The Enterprise Volume Management System (EVMS) Project
has the goal of providing unparalleled flexibility and
extensibility in managing storage. It represents a new
approach to logical volume management for Linux.
The architecture introduces a plug-in model that allows
for easy expansion and customization of various levels
of volume management.
EVMS provides a single, unified system for handling all
of your storage management tasks. EVMS recognizes all of
the disks on your system and allows for a variety of
partitioning schemes. Software-RAID and logical volume
groups can be managed in EVMS. Filesystems can be created
and checked, and are automatically updated when changes
are made to the underlying volumes. With EVMS, there is no
longer a need for several individual utilities for
performing each of these tasks.
