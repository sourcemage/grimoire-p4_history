 Gnome Toaster is a cd creation suite for Linux and FreeBSD (testers wanted!). Thought to be as user-friendly as possible it lets you create cd recordables with just a few simple mouse clicks. Create your CDs by simply dragging the desired contents onto it's display window. Although certainly the various programs available for Windows have been an example how people expect an easy-to-use cd creation suit to be, Gnometoaster is trying to do things differently in various ways. Not only can Gnometoaster write mp3 files to a disc on-the-fly, it can also encode them. Besides mp3, almost all other common file formats can be used by just specifying their respecting commandline players as a "plugin" in Gnometoaster's unique Filetype registry. This is how Gnometoaster gains maximum use of the immensely large collection of tools available to the Linux community, combining them all into a single, easy to use interface for a specific purpose.
