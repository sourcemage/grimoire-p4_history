cat << EOF
binchunker converts a CD image in a ".bin / .cue" format 
(sometimes ".raw / .cue") to a set of .iso and .cdr tracks. The bin/cue format 
is used by some non-Unix cd-writing software, but is not supported on most 
other cd-writing programs.

The .iso track contains an ISO file system, which can be mounted through a loop 
device on Linux systems, or written on a CD-R using cdrecord. The .cdr tracks 
are in the native CD audio format. They can be either written on a CD-R using 
cdrecord -audio, or converted to WAV (or any other sound format for that matter) 
using sox.
