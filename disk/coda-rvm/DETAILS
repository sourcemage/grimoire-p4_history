           SHORT="Recoverable Virtual Memory library for Coda"
cat << EOF
RVM provides an unstructured recoverable virtual memory. The recoverable storage is represented by Unix files or disk partitions that applications can map at page granularity into the address space of a process. Simple, non-nested atomic transactions guarantee permanence of changes to recoverable storage across system crashes. Applications can schedule transaction logging actions to enhance performance. The design stresses simplicity, ease of use, and high performance. Unix compatibility is standard, while optional Mach-specific extensions are supported for additional flexibility and performance. RVM has been extensively used in the clients and servers of the Coda File System, and in the Venari system.
