- Moved make instaal back into "FIFO"
- Fixed Makefile to NOT do the password thingy
- Added POST_INSTAL which does the checking for the password existance, and 
  then create it or not.

- hacked BUILD script to fix the bug if VOYEUR is off. The spell is 
  asking a password and if fifo enabled, no user intervention. I took
  the make install part out of the fifo.

- added ACL documentation to the spell, hacked DETAILS and PRE_BUILD
  scripts. The doc is now installed via the standard install mechanism
