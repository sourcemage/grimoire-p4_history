		Moved make instaal back into "FIFO"
		Fixed Makefile to NOT do the password thingy

		Hacked BUILD script to fix the bug if VOYEUR is off. The spell is asking a password and if fifo enabled, no user intervention. I took the make install part out of the fifo.

		Added ACL documentation to the spell, hacked DETAILS and PRE_BUILD scripts. The doc is now installed via the standard install mechanism
