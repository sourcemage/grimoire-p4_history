Mount ISO Image is an advanced script which allows to perform multiple
operations with ISO, NRG (Nero Burning ROM), UDF (DVD), CUE/BIN, CCD/IMG/SUB
(CloneCD), XDVDFS (XBOX) images.

Mount/unmount operations can be performed in two different ways: using kdesu or
sudo. During the installation you'll be offered to choose a variant to use.

Note: If you prefer to use sudo, you should first choose to "Setup sudo config"
in installation menu.
