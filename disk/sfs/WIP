Trying to resolve http://bugs.sourcemage.org/show_bug.cgi?id=5824
Current version does not compile with gcc3.3, CVS version is ok

Have to find a workaround to pass something to "sfskey gen -P /etc/sfs/sfs_host_key" so that
it doesn't wait for a user prompt.

echo "foo
foofoofoofoo" | sfskey gen -P /etc/sfs/sfs_host_key

doesn't work
