cat << EOF
Davfs2 is a Linux file system driver that allows you to mount a WebDAV server
as a local disk drive. Davfs2 uses Coda for kernel driver and neon for WebDAV
interface.
WebDAV is an extension to HTTP that allows remote collaborative authoring of
Web resources, defined in RFC 2518.
Davfs allows a remote Web server to be edited using standard applications that
interact with the file system. For example, a remote Web site could be updated
in-place using the same development tools that initially created the site.
Davfs supports SSL and proxy server.
