The files which name ends in ".rules" will be read by udev in lexical order.
Any others will be ignored.
There are some example rules in rules.examples, take a look at those for
an idea of what's possible with udev.

When a rule matches in one file, a different rule in another file will be
ignored, so be sure to name your own files properly.

Be sure to leave 50-default.rules as it is, so the spell can update it when needed.
