cat << EOF
In short, GNUstep Renaissance allows you to describe your user
interfaces (that is, the windows in your application, and the buttons,
boxes, textfields, etc in the windows) in simple and intuitive XML
files, using an open, standard format describing the logic of the
interface.  GNUstep Renaissance can then, at run time, generate the
user interfaces (using the native host OpenStep-like libraries) by
reading the XML files.  The connections between the objects created
from the XML files, and the other objects in the application are done
via outlets (as traditionally in OpenStep); a new quick and intuitive
syntax has been developed to make creating outlets as easy as
possible.
