cat << EOF
Redact is an Edje compiler written in Ruby.

Unlike the official Edje compiler, edje_cc, Redact doesnât read EDC code â
it reads Ruby code instead. This means that Redact will allow you to write
Edjes in a full-blown programming language.

So why is this a good thing?

With edje_cc, the only way to automate the creation of parts and/or programs
is to use CPP macros, which are very limited feature-wise and hard to debug.

Also, it means that syntax errors wonât go unnoticed anymore :)

Status

Redact supports most of edje_ccâs features. Itâs lacking support for image
compression options and the âfillâ parameters for image descriptions. And
probably other minor stuff.  Thatâs not an excuse for you not to try out
Redact though! :)
