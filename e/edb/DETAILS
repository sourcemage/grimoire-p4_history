EDB is a database convenience library wrapped around the Berkeley DB 2.7.7 by
Sleepycat Software. It is intended to make accessing database information
portable, easy, fast and efficient.

EDB provides an excellent method of storing and retrieving application
configuration information, although it can be used for more extensively than
that. Ebits, the predecessor to Edje, even used EDB as a container for Ebits
themes prior to EET. An Edb consists of a series of key/value pairs, which can
consist of a variety of data types, including integers, floating point values,
strings, and binary data. The simplified API provides simple, complete, and
unified functions for managing and accessing your database.

In addition to the library, a variety of tools are available to access and
modify your EDBs. edb_ed provides a simple command line interface that can
easily be scripted, especially useful for use with the GNU autotools suite.
edb_vt_ed provides an easy to use curses interface. And edb_gtk_ed provides an
elegant and easy GUI interface, especially useful for end user editing of
configuration data contained in EDBs.
