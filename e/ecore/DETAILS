What is Ecore? It is the core event abstraction layer and X abstraction layer that makes doing selections, Xdnd, general X stuff, and event loops, timeouts and idle handlers fast, optimized, and convenient. It's a separate library so anyone can make use of the work put into Ecore to make this job easy for applications.

Ecore is completely modular. At its base is the event handlers and timers, and initialization and shutdown functions.
