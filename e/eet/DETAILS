EET is a tiny library designed to write an arbitary set of chunks of data to a file and optionally compress each chunk (very much like a zip file) and allow fast random-access reading of the file later on. It does not do zip as a zip itself has more complexity than is needed, and it was much simpler to impliment this once here.

Eet is extremely fast, small and simple. Eet files can be very small and highly compressed, making them very optimal for just sending across the internet without having to archive, compress or decompress and install them. They allow for lightning-fast random-acess reads once created, making them perfect for storing data that is written once (or rarely) and read many times, but the program does not want to have to read it all in at once.
