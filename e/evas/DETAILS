cat << EOF
Evas is a canvas library, designed to work with the X Window System.
It is designed to be able to take advantage of any graphics hardware
or CPU processing power you may have, or to adjust for the lack of
it. It has a simplistic API to access the features of a canvas to aid 
in making development using Evas easy.
