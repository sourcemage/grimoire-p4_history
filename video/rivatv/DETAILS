cat << EOF
The RivaTV project is trying to produce linux drivers for graphics boards with an nVidia chip that have a video-in feature. The best known boards with this feature are ones made by Asus and Elsa.
Actually, the project should be called something like "nv-video-in", but "RivaTV" sounds better. Besides, we're stuck with it now.
