cat << EOF
Movie files can be viewed with subtitles, which are currently 
very popular as text files. The command line tool 'subs' and 
its perl backend Subtitles.pm provide means for simple loading, 
re-timing, converting, and storing these subtitle files. 
Supported formats are .srt, .sub, .smi, and .idx.
