cat << EOF
Cinelerra is not intended for consumer use. Much better alternatives for ease
of use and simplicity are Virtualdub, Kino, MJPEG tools.
 
If you want to make movies, you want the compositing and editing that the big
boys use, you want the efficiency of an embedded UNIX operating system
combined with the power of a general purpose PC, or you just want to defy the
establishment, the time has come.
 
Imagine a renderfarm where you don't need to pay for node licenses. Imagine a
laptop which didn't need dongles to run anything. Imagine not having to phone
in and wait a week to renew licenses every week.
