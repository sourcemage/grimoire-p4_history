I integrated version 2.0 to test, but without the shared patch.  I 
attempted to make the new shared patch like the old one, but something 
isn't working.  It builds with the patch applied, but doesn't create 
executables, so the install fails.  Need to review compile logs with and 
without patch.  Leaving the old patch for comparision.
