CamStream is (going to be) a collection of tools for webcams and other
video-devices, enhancing your Linux system with multimedia video. All written
in C++ and with a nice GUI frontend. The interface is based on Qt, an excellent
GUI framework.

The aim of this project is build a set of programs for:

 * Webcamming, that is saving an image and uploading it to a server at regular
   intervals;
 * Video conferencing;
 * Webcam broadcast (including server);
 * Recording movie clips (AVI, Quicktime) from a webcam (and playing them back);
 * Using a webcam as a security camera.
