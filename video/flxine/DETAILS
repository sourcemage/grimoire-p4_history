Flxine is a graphical user interface to the xine media library, I began putting it together so that I could make a good solid interface class for another peice of software that I am working on for my car. The flxine program started to come together, and even work, so I went ahead and added more functionality than I was ever planning to, like automatically scanning all the auto-play and visualization plugins and allowing you to run any of them on the fly.

The gui is built entirely with the FLTK gui designer tool called fluid, and the xine interface uses the xine 1.0 library.
