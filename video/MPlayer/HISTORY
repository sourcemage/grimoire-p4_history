		Updated to pre8.

		Basically rewrote the spell with the real optional dependencies,
		a cleaner BUILD (well, it would be really cleaner if the MPlayer
		developers had provided a working makefile ;)
		and a sane default config (done in POST_INSTALL).

		Moved the font installation in a seperate spell MPlayer-fonts,
		since they are only needed if MPlayer is compiled without
		freetype2 support.
		
		Moved the gui skin installation in a seperate spell MPlayer-gui,
		so it doesn't get downloaded if the user doesn't want the gui.

		Updated to pre6. Will fix the MD5 field as soon as my 56k connection
will permit...

                Cleaned up the spell and fixed some issues:

                the fonts get installed when the gui isn't build (the fonts
                actually don't have anything to do with the gui, they are
                used for subtitles and the osd)

                the spell only installs the default skin for the gui if
                it is build (there are now 20 skins for the mplayer gui, it's
                not user friendly to download all, users can download their
                preffered skin to their .mplayer directory like they can for
                xmms)

                dispel and resurrect now really works (including the osd font)
