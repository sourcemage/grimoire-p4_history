                Cleaned up the spell and fixed some issues:

                the fonts get installed when the gui isn't build (the fonts
                actually don't have anything to do with the gui, they are
                used for subtitles and the osd)

                the spell only installs the default skin for the gui if
                it is build (there are now 20 skins for the mplayer gui, it's
                not user friendly to download all, users can download their
                preffered skin to their .mplayer directory like they can for
                xmms)

                dispel and resurrect now really works (including the osd font)
