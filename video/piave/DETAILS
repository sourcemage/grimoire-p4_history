PIAVE is a render and effect engine, developed and currently running
on GNU/Linux. PIAVE can be used in various ways. You can link your
own project with libpiave and use it's features. The Modesto GUI does 
this. As a standalone application PIAVE can read the description of a 
project in XML format and start rendering. In server mode, you can
connect a client (e.g. a GUI) to PIAVE via a tcp connection and
remote control the engine. KdenLive uses this feature.
