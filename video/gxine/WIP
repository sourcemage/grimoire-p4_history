always crashes shortly after switching to fullscreen mode

Works like a charm on my laptop ! Maybe a configuration problem ?

Don't think so, it crashes with every usable video out driver, for a new user and with at least three different windowmanagers (metacity, fvwm and twm).
And gxine 0.5.3 works.
