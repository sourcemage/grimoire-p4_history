SHORT="copy VOB files from DVD's"
cat << EOF
vobcopy copies DVD .vob files to harddisk, decrypting (if you have
libdvdcss installed)
them on the way (thanks to libdvdread and libdvdcss) and merges them into file(s) with
the name extracted from the DVD. It checks for enough free space on the destination
drive and compares the copied size to the size on DVD (in case something went wrong
during the copying). vobcopy without any options will copy the first title into files
of 2GB size into the current working directory.
