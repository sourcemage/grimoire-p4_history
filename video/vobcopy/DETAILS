vobcopy copies DVD .vob files to harddisk, decrypting (if you have libdvdcss
installed) them on the way (thanks to libdvdread and libdvdcss) and merges them
into file(s) with the name extracted from the DVD. It checks for enough free
space on the destination drive and compares the copied size to the size on DVD
(in case something went wrong during the copying). vobcopy without any options
will copy the first title into files of 2GB size into the current working
directory.
