2002-09-24 Arwed v. Merkatz <v.merkatz@gmx.net>
	* DETAILS: Updated to pre8.
	* ALL: Basically rewrote the spell with the real optional dependencies,
	a cleaner BUILD (well, it would be really cleaner if the MPlayer
	developers had provided a working makefile ;) and a sane default config,
	done in POST_INSTALL.
	Moved the font installation in a seperate spell MPlayer-fonts, since
	they are only needed if MPlayer is compiled without freetype2 support.
	Moved the gui skin installation in a seperate spell MPlayer-gui, so it
	doesn't get downloaded if the user doesn't want the gui.

2002-09-03 Unet <burududu@hotpop.com>
	* DETAILS: Updated to pre6. Will fix the MD5 field as soon as my 56k
	connection will permit...

2002-06-10 Unet <burududu@hotpop.com>
	* DETAILS: Updated to 0.90pre5, added MAINTAINER and LICENSE field

2002-05-31 Arwed v.Merkatz <v.merkatz@gmx.net>
	* ALL: Cleaned up the spell and fixed some issues:
	The fonts get installed when the gui isn't build (the fonts actually
	don't have anything to do with the gui, they are used for subtitles
	and the osd).
	The spell only installs the default skin for the gui if it is build,
	there are now 20 skins for the mplayer gui, it's not user friendly to
	download all, users can download their preffered skin to their .mplayer
	directory like they can for xmms).
	dispel and resurrect now really works (including the osd font).
