MPlayer is a movie player for LINUX (runs on many other Unices, and non-x86
CPUs, see the documentation). It plays most MPEG, VOB, AVI, VIVO, ASF/WMV,
QT/MOV, FLI, NuppelVideo, yuv4mpeg, FILM, RoQ, OGG and some RealMedia files,
supported by many native, XAnim, and Win32 DLL codecs.
You can watch VideoCD, SVCD, DVD, 3ivx, FLI, and even DivX movies too (and you
don't need the avifile library at all!).
Another big feature of mplayer is the wide range of supported output drivers.
It works with X11, Xv, DGA, OpenGL, SVGAlib, fbdev, AAlib, but you can use SDL
(and this way all drivers of SDL), VESA (on every VESA compatible card,even
without X!), and some lowlevel card-specific drivers (for Matrox, 3Dfx and
Radeon) too! Most of them supports software or hardware scaling, so you can
enjoy movies in fullscreen.
MPlayer supports displaying through some hardware MPEG decoder boards, such as the DVB and  DXR3/Hollywood+ !
And what about the nice big antialiased shaded subtitles (9 supported types!!!) with european/ISO 8859-1,2 (hungarian, english, czech, etc), cyrillic, korean fonts, and OSD?
