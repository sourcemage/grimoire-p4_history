Transcode is a text console video-stream processing tool. It supports elementary video and audio frame transformations. Some example modules are included to enable import of MPEG-1/2, Digital Video, and other formats. It also includes export modules for writing to AVI files with DivX, OpenDivX, XviD, Digital Video or other codecs. Direct DVD transcoding is also supported. A set of tools is available to extract and decode the sources into raw video/audio streams for import and to enable post-processing of AVI files.
