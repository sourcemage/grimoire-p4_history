	* Moved z-video/xvid to devel grimoire video-libs/xvid

2004-01-27 hgg <hgreig@bigpond.net.au>
	* bash: spell has changed to now source files from /etc/profile.d/*.sh
	The spells that used to add variables to /etc/profile have been modified to install /etc/profile.d/*.sh
	files now, but to avoid having to recast all of these the bash spell will attempt to convert your current
	/etc/profile and will back it up to /etc/profile.d/profile. It would be extremely wise to check it has
	worked before logging out or rebooting

2004-01-08 hgg <hgreig@bigpond.net.au>
	* libnjb-cvs removed, dispel libnjb-cvs, then cast -r -c libnjb to choose cvs version if wanted

2004-01-05 Eric Sandall <eric@sandall.us>
	* devel/MAINTAINER: Open section
	* ChangeLog: Added
	* GRIMOIRE: optional_requires is now in all grimoires

2003-10-03  hgg <hgreig@bigpond.net.au>
	* GRIMOIRE: test grimoire now has support for optional_requires to allow full use of xfree86-devel or
	xfree86-libs or xdirectfb spells to provide x11-{libs,server}.
	THE CATCH IS YOU MUST USE DEVEL SORCERY OR YOU WILL GET NOTHING BUT ERRORS DURING CAST.
