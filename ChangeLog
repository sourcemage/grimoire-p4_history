	* video/bcast/*: removed bcast spell, the software is unmaintained and
	  broken

2004-01-29 Eric Sandall <eric@sandall.us>
	* Moved z-video/xvid to devel grimoire video-libs/xvid

2004-01-27 hgg <hgreig@bigpond.net.au>
	* bash: spell has changed to now source files from /etc/profile.d/*.sh
	  The spells that used to add variables to /etc/profile have been modified
	  to install /etc/profile.d/*.sh files now, but to avoid having to recast
	  all of these the bash spell will attempt to convert your current
	  /etc/profile and will back it up to /etc/profile.d/profile. It would be
	  extremely wise to check it has worked before logging out or rebooting

2004-01-08 hgg <hgreig@bigpond.net.au>
	* libnjb-cvs: removed, dispel libnjb-cvs, then cast -r -c libnjb to choose
	  cvs version if wanted

2004-01-05 Eric Sandall <eric@sandall.us>
	* devel/MAINTAINER: Open section
	* ChangeLog: Added
	* GRIMOIRE: optional_requires is now in all grimoires

2003-10-03  hgg <hgreig@bigpond.net.au>
	* GRIMOIRE: test grimoire now has support for optional_requires to allow
	  full use of xfree86-devel or xfree86-libs or xdirectfb spells to provide
	  x11-{libs,server}.  THE CATCH IS YOU MUST USE DEVEL SORCERY OR YOU WILL
	  GET NOTHING BUT ERRORS DURING CAST.
