2005-08-18 Jeremy Blosser <jblosser-smgl@firinn.org>
	* gnu.gpg: Added, this is a "stripped" version of the ftp.gnu.org
	  gnu-keyring.gpg, created via 'gpg --no-default-keyring --keyring
	  ./gnu-keyring.gpg --export --export-options export-minimal
	  >./gnu.gpg'.  The original filesize was 353,913 bytes, the sha1sum
	  was '29ae4b6097e6e7d76a75b8a3fbf420cfcd9927d8'.  All the keys in this

	  except for 0x0E89DA12 (does not exist on either keyserver) and
	  0xB565716F (verified on subkeys.gpg.net, does not exist on
	  pgp.mit.edu).  Efforts to also verify these keys on the Web or via
	  email with upstream have not been successful so far.

2005-07-13 Eric Sandall <eric@sandall.us>
	* perl-cpan/time-date: Added for svn-mirror 0.64
	* shell-term-fm/MAINTAINER: Vladimir has been AWOL for a while now
	* FUNCTIONS: install_shell should match the exact string, not just any
	  part of it (e.g. /bin/tcsh used to match /usr/bin/tcsh).
	  remove_shell should match the exact string, not just any
	  part of it (e.g. /bin/tcsh used to match /usr/bin/tcsh).
	  remove_shell no longer uselessly uses cat

2005-07-11 Eric Sandall <eric@sandall.us>
	* perl-cpan/{class-accessor,file-chdir}: Added for svn-mirror 0.64

2005-06-20 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* FUNCTIONS: Add a compatibility unpack_file function in case someone
	  uses an early adopter but has not updated sorcery.

2005-06-14 Eric Sandall <eric@sandall.us>
	* graphics/tiff: Moved to graphics-libs/tiff

2005-06-13 Eric Sandall <eric@sandall.us>
	* shell-term-fm/krusader: Moved to kde-apps/krusader (will soon use
	  the KDE-generic scripts)

2005-06-10 Eric Sandall <eric@sandall.us>
	* kde-core/{KDE_BUILD,KDE_CONFIGURE},
	  kde-apps/{KDE_BUILD,KDE_CONFIGURE}: Don't change config_query types
	  and still use the same variable name (e.g. KDE_DEBUG was
	  config_query, but then I changed it to config_query_option, so now if
	  you don't use `cast -r <kde spell>` you'll get a "n" or "y" in your
	  KDE_DEBUG variable along with the --*-debug flag, which'll break
	  ./configure (thanks to George Sherwood for finding this problem)
	  So I've renamed the variables that used to use config_query and now
	  use config_query_option (KDE_DEBUG and KDE_FINAL only) and updated
	  http://wiki.sourcemage.org/index.php?page=CONFIGURE
	* libs/elementtree: Added
	  Python light-weight components for working with XML

	  C implementation of the ElementTree API

	  Fake root environment

2005-06-08 Ladislav Hagara <hgr@vabo.cz>
	* x11-libs/MesaLib: removed deprecated spell

2005-06-06 Eric Sandall <eric@sandall.us>
	* kde-core/KDE_CONFIGURE: Added query for new ldflags support.
	  Change most queries to config_query_option (since they have flags).
	* kde-core/KDE_BUILD: Pass query flags to OPTS (simplified KDE_BUILD).
	  Pass --disable-dependency-tracking to speed up builds (enabling this
	  is only useful if you're going to be compiling in the same tree more
	  than once).
	  Pass kde_confdir=$INSTALL_ROOT/etc/kde so that config files are
	  installed into /etc/kde instead of /usr/share/config. I haven't
	  tested this with anything other than the default INSTALL_ROOT so I'm
	  not sure if packages will load correctly (since they may have
	  INSTALL_ROOT built into their config), but the files do need to go to
	  INSTALL_ROOT/etc/kde, not
	  TRACK_ROOT/etc/kde.
	* kde-apps/ChangeLog: Pulled entries into ChangeLog and removed
	  kde-apps/ChangeLog
	* kde-apps/{KDE_BUILD,KDE_CONFIGURE,KDE_DEPENDS: Synced with kde-core
	  files

2005-06-05 Thomas Houssin <Thomas.Houssin@sourcemage.org>
	* Added spell utils/nut

2005-06-01 Eric Sandall <eric@sandall.us>
	* FUNCTIONS: Modified install_www_files to use install_config_file
	  Takes a directory to install and uses find to install all files from
	  that directory on
	  Add warning for new file locations so no one can reasonably say that they
	  were not told. ;)
	* collab/HORDE_INSTALL: Updated to use install_www_file
	  HORDE_DIR is now /usr/share/www/horde (to match install_www_file)
	  Cleanup message formatting
	  Use pushd/popd instead of cd
	  Only make config symlink if config files were installed

2005-05-18 Eric Sandall <eric@sandall.us>
	* net/EthStatus: Removed deprecated spell
	* php-pear/pear-pear: Renamed to php-pear/pear ;)

2005-04-23 Arwed v. Merkatz <v.merkatz@gmx.net>
	* FUNCTIONS, libgcc: added functions to switch the gcc version used by
	  a spell
	* FUNCTIONS: override default_build so spells not having a BUILD file
	  only need GCC_VERSION in DETAILS and a dependency on the gcc version

2005-04-22 Thomas Houssin <Thomas.Houssin@sourcemage.org>
	* graphics/xv: moved to z-rejected/z-graphics 

2005-04-17 Arwed v. Merkatz <v.merkatz@gmx.net>

	  The spells that used to add variables to /etc/profile have been

	  having to recast all of these the bash spell will attempt to convert
	  your current /etc/profile and will back it up to
	  /etc/profile.d/profile. It would be extremely wise to check it has
	  worked before logging out or rebooting

	  OR YOU WILL GET NOTHING BUT ERRORS DURING CAST.
