make[1]: *** [errors.o] Error 1

The reason for this is that the gcc running there is the one included in the
gnat 3.15 binary, which is _very_ old. The solution is to use a newer gcc + ada
binary to bootstrap. This seems to work fine here, I just haven't had the
chance to build a i386 one yet that could be used in the spell. If anyone has a
i386 cache of gcc + ada spells (any version > 3.3 should do), please contact
me.
