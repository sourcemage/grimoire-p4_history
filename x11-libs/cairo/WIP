new libpixman + cairo break poppler and libsvg-cairo/xsvg

----------
2005-06-14
- poppler is updated
- libsvg/libsvg-cairo/xsvg have been switched to cvs so they work
- cairo-gtk-engine is broken and seems unmaintained, probably a candidate for
  deprecation
- mozilla cairo engine is probably broken by this, needs testing
- waimea cvs version is broken and currently not developed
- evas needs testing
- gst-plugins doesn't like cairo 0.5 yet, will be fixed in the next release
- fdclock is broken and cvs seems to be inactive
