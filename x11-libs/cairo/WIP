0.9.2 ----

The cairo 1.0 release will be source and binary compatible with the
cairo 0.9.x series. All API changes in cairo 0.9.x are finalized at
this point, and cairo 0.9.x should be considered API frozen. Barring
discovery of serious issues with the new APIs, no API changes are
anticipated between this release and the 1.0 release.

As of version 2.7/2.8, GTK+ now performs much of its drawing through
cairo and allows application code to perform rendering through cairo.

Libpixman dependency dropped
----------------------------
 * As of this release, the dependency on an internal libpixman has
   been dropped. Instead, the code from libpixman needed for cairo has
   been incorporated into the cairo source tree. The motivation for
   this change is that while cairo's API is stable and ready to be
   maintained after the 1.0 release, libpixman's API is not, so we do
   not want to expose it at this time.

   Also, the incorporation of libpixman into cairo also renames all
   previously-public libpixman symbols in order to avoid any conflict
   with a future release of libpixman

0.5.0 -----

new libpixman + cairo break poppler and libsvg-cairo/xsvg

----------
2005-06-14
- poppler is updated
- libsvg/libsvg-cairo/xsvg have been switched to cvs so they work
- cairo-gtk-engine is broken and seems unmaintained, probably a candidate for
  deprecation
- mozilla cairo engine is probably broken by this, needs testing
- waimea cvs version is broken and currently not developed
- evas needs testing
- gst-plugins doesn't like cairo 0.5 yet, will be fixed in the next release
- fdclock is broken and cvs seems to be inactive
----------
2005-09-08
- poppler in devel works
- libsvg, libsvg-cairo, xsvg in devel work
- fdclock, cairo-gtk-engine and gst-plugins work
- evas doesn't use cairo anymore
- waimea cvs is broken and not actively developed
