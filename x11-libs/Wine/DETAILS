Wine Is Not an Emulator. It is an alternative
implementation of the Windows 3.x and Win32 APIs. Wine
provides both a development toolkit (Winelib) for porting
legacy Windows sources to Unix and a program loader,
allowing unmodified Windows 3.1/95/NT binaries to run
under Intel Unixes. Wine does not require Microsoft
Windows, as it is a completely alternative implementation
consisting of 100% Microsoft-Free code, but it can
optionally use native system DLLs if they are available.
