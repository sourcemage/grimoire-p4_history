The wine config file and registry have changed
The first use of wine should create or update the registry and config files
Try running a wine application from the command line and you should get some messages 
such as:

$ wine notepad
Created symlink /home/treeve/.wine/dosdevices/a:: -> /dev/fd0
Created symlink /home/treeve/.wine/dosdevices/r:: -> /dev/cdrw
Created symlink /home/treeve/.wine/dosdevices/v:: -> /dev/cdrom

You can now remove the [SerialPorts], [ParallelPorts], and [Drive] sections
in your configuration file, they are replaced by the above symlinks.
