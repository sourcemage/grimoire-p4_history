	* ALL: Modified spell to support version 4.2.0 & Linux-PAM

2002-01-10 Kyle Sallee <anonymous@sourcemage.org>
	* ALL: I was incorrect about my assumptions on 20020109. 
	  The problem turned out to be mistake in a
	  xc/programs/Xserver/hw/xfree86/os-support/linux/drm/kernel/drm.h
	  within the xfree86 source. I included a patch.

2002-01-09 Kyle Sallee <anonymous@sourcemage.org>
	* ALL: Modified BUILD so that "#define BuildXF86DRM NO" is added to
	  config/cf/host.def is "CONFIG_DRM=y" is in
	  /usr/src/linux/.config. In simple terms an SA can compile DRM
	  in xfree86 or the linux kernel, but not both, otherwise xfree86
	  fails to compile & install. Jon Svendsen figured out the
	  conflict, I added the fix. Great teamwork, Jon!

2002-01-02 Kyle Sallee <anonymous@sourcemage.org>
	* ALL: Modified CONFIGURE to give SAs a more precise configuration.
