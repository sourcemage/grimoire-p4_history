	* Created spell
	* DEPENDS: Forced dependency to imlib2 - see web page for
	  alternatives... Next update of this spell should take
	  alternatives into consideration (likely with the
	  provides/requires features), but as this will require
	  modifications to several other spells, I decided not to
	  include that in my first cut.
