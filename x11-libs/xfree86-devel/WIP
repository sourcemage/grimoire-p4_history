I made a private copy of this spell which uses a single tar.bz2 file,
instead of applying cumulative patches.
It builds and runs ok.


There is definitely something wrong with the patching.
Also the source tree is significantly smaller when using the single 
tarball.

apparently alias is old code which should have been removed.

there is something wrong with the cumulative patching process
I removed the fontfile.diff, as it is part of *.903, but fontfile.c is 
still wrong.
