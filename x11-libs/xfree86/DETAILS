What is XFree86?

The XFree86 Project, Inc is an organisation which produces
XFree86, a freely redistributable open-source
implementation of the X Window System that runs on UNIX(R)
and UNIX-like (like Linux, the BSDs, Mac OS X (aka Darwin)
and Solaris x86 series) operating systems and OS/2.

XFree86 is the underlying software that is between the
hardware and graphical user interface (aka gui) that
people see and use. If you are using KDE, GNOME,
Enlightenment, Blackbox, AfterStep, twm or fvwm then you
are already using and running XFree86 as these run as our
clients.  Traditionally, The XFree86 Project has focused
on Intel x86-based platforms, which is where the 86 in our
name comes from, but our current release supports other
platforms like the Alpha, PowerPC, Sparc and in-the-works
MIPS CPU families.

Our goal at XFree86 is to have X run on every platform
available, including those we do not currently support, as
the best windowing system available on that platform.
