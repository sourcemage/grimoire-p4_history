FVWM is a multiple large virtual desktop window manager originally
derived from twm. FVWM is intended to have a small memory footprint and
a rich feature set, be extremely customizable and extendable and have a
high degree of Motif mwm compatibility. FVWM is highly extensible
through its module interface.
