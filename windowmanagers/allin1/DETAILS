SHORT="a WindowMaker dockapp combining Memory, Swap, Battery, CPU, and Net monitors"
cat << EOF
Allin1, written by Mario, is a little dock applet for FluxBox and similar window managers, such as WindowMaker,  which monitors CPU load with a moving graph, memory and swap usage with histograms, battery and power status with histogram and icons, and ethernet/PPP interfaces with icons and histograms (linear or logaritmic).  Configuration file is /etc/allin1.conf and at least one monitor must be removed to view the full dockapp in 64x64, or you can expand your icons to 72x72.
