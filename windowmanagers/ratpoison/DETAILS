cat << EOF
Ratpoison is a simple Window Manager with no fat library dependencies,
no fancy graphics, no window decorations, and no rodent dependence. It
is largely modelled after GNU Screen which has done wonders in virtual
terminal market.

All windows are maximized and kept maximized to take full advantage of
your precious screen real estate.

All interaction with the window manager is done through keystrokes.
ratpoison has a prefix map to minimize the key clobbering that cripples
Emacs and other quality pieces of software.
