# Example from:  http://insitu.lri.fr/~chapuis/metisse/running.html
#
# FvwmAmetista uses OpenGL. It is strongly recommended to use it with a 3D
# capable video card and an X server which takes advantage of it.
#
# Under an usual (3D accelerated) X session start Xwnc on a free display:
#
#   Xwnc -ac -geometry widthxheight  :a_free_display
#
# which gives for example:
#
#   Xwnc -ac -geometry 1024x768  :1
#
# If you do not want to use the -ac option (disable access control restrictions)
# and if you never run an X server on the Xwnc display, you should use xauth to
# create an entry in the ~/.Xauthority file. Type "xauth list" to see if you
# have such entry. Something like:
#
#   co=`hostname`":the_free_dpy MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1 "`mcookie`; xauth add $co
#
# should create one.
#
# Xwnc listen for WNC connections on a TCP port and accept, by default, all
# connections. If you have a vnc password file (~/.vnc/passwd, you can create
# one with vncpasswd) you can use the Xwnc "-rfbauth" option to specify this
# file. Then, Xwnc will ask for a password.
#
# Type "Xwnc -help" for the full list of the Xwnc options.
#
# Then start fvwm and FvwmAmetista:
#
#   metisse-start-fvwm -wd :the_Xwnc_display [-wp password]
#
# The -wd option is needed only if the Xwnc display is not :1.
#
# The first time you run metisse-start-fvwm, it creates a new directory
# .fvwm-metisse in your $HOME and install some configuration files in this
# directory. The .fvwm2rc file should not be edited. You may have to edit some
# of these configurations files to feet your need and to develop simple
# experimentation. See the next section, read the head of ametistarc and see the
# fvwm man page as well as the FVWM modules man pages.

exec  Xwnc  -ac  :$DISPLAY  &
exec  metisse-start-fvwm  -wd  :$DISPLAY
