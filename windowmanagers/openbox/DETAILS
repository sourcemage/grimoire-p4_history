Openbox is a window manager with an enhanced Blackbox style-engine that
supports the KDE and GNOME2 desktop environments and their applications. It
provides a familiar environment to Blackbox users with added
customizability. The key handler, epist, provides full key-chain-combo
support, support for bindings without modifiers, and the ability to pop up
Openbox menus.
