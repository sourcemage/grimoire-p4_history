window manager improved 2 (wmii) is an improved, modularized and
lightweight X11 window manager which supports tabbed, tiled and
conventional window management through layouts.
If it is built with cairo support, it also provides
anti-aliased font rendering.
wmii consists of components that are independent processes and
communicate via a socket-based virtual filesystem which is oriented
on the "everything is file" paradigm of the plan9 operating system.
The core distribution of wmii contains the window manager itself,
a master file system routing utility (wmifs), a generic bar (wmibar),
a shortcut handler (wmikeys), and a generic interaction menu (wmiinput)
beside several tiny utilities like wmir, wmiplumb, and wmiwarp.
