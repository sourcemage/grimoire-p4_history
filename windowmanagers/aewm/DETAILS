SHORT="aewm: a minimalistic X11 window manager."
cat << EOF
aewm is a minimalistic window manager for X11 with few nifty
features, but is *extremely* light on resources and simple in
appearance.  It's codebase includes a few seperate programs to
handle running programs, switching between windows, etc.

This codebase was originally inspired by 9wm, and has spawned
several other complete window managers.  I can best describe
it as "the smallest, coolest, most hack-a-licious window
manager for X11 in the cosmos".
