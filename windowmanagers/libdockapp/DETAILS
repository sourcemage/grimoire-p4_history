cat << EOF
LibDockApp is a library that provides a framework for developing dockapps. It 
provides functions and structures to define and display command-line options, 
create a dockable icon, handle events, etc.
The goal of the library is to provide a simple, yet clean interface and 
standardize the ways in which dockapps are developed. A dockapp developed 
using libDockApp will automatically behave well under most window managers, 
and especially well under Window Maker.
