tpager or Tiny Pager is a very lightweight application designed to be fast and small. It shows your workspaces and allows you to change between them.

There are numerous arguments that you can use to change the pager's layout.

The program is developed using C and Xlib so there are no big dependencies needed.

This pager is in compliance with EWMH, so it is supported on Gnome, Kde, Xfce4, Rox, Openbox and every other window manager or desktop system that support these standards.
