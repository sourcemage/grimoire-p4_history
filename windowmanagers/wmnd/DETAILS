cat << EOF
WMND (WindowMaker Network Devices) is a network monitoring
dockapp for Window Maker (and compatibles) for many operative systems.
Improved and based on WMiFS 1.3b, the version 0.2 of WMND is almost
totally written by Timecop, given the optimization and flexibility and
now consumes less cpu than wmmon. Version >= 0.3 WMND is now
maintained by wave++, which added new display modes and several new
drivers. Enjoy!
