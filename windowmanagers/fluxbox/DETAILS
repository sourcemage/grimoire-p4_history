SHORT="Fluxbox is yet another windowmanager!"
cat << EOF
Fluxbox is yet another windowmanager!

It is based on the Blackbox 0.61.1 code. Fluxbox looks like blackbox
and handles styles, colors, window placement and similar thing exactly
like blackbox. 

FEATURES:
Here are the major features of fluxbox:
* Our custom keygrabber (support for emacs-styled kkeychains)
* Iconbar (the toolbar shows minimized windows, one click and they pop back up)
* Configurable titlebar (placement of buttons, new buttons etc)
* Window tabs (see this page for more info and screenshot)
In addition to all this many small fixes and minor features have been added
