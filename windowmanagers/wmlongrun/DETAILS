SHORT="WindowMaker dockapp to monitor Longrun settings for Crusoe processors"
cat << EOF
WMLongRun is a program to monitor for LongRun. It displays
the current LongRun settings and status (the frequency, the LongRun
flags, and the performance level). It's a dockapp that is supported by X
window managers such as Window Maker, AfterStep, BlackBox, and
Enlightenment. It has two user interfaces: an LCD look-alike user
interface, and an LED-interface. If you select the LCD-interface, the
back-light may be turned on/off by clicking the mouse button over the
application. It runs under GNU/Linux.
