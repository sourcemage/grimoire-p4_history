SHORT="Sawfish is an extensible X11 window manager"
cat << EOF
Sawfish is an extensible window manager using a Lisp-based scripting 
language --all window decorations are configurable and all user-interface 
policy is controlled through the extension language. This is no layer on 
top of twm, but a wholly new architecture.
Despite this extensibility its policy is very minimal compared to most 
window managers. Its aim is simply to manage windows in the most flexible 
and attractive manner possible. As such it does not implement desktop 
backgrounds, applications docks, or other things that may be achieved 
through separate applications.
