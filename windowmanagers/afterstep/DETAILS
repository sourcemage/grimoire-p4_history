cat << EOF
AfterStep is a Window Manager for X which started by emulating the
NeXTSTEP look and feel, but which has been significantly altered
according to the requests of various users. Many adepts will tell you
that NeXTSTEP is not only the most visually pleasant interface, but
also one of the most functional and intuitive out there. AfterStep
aims to incorporate the advantages of the NeXTSTEP interface, and add
additional useful features.
