SHORT="WindowMaker dockapp displays a ticker"
cat << EOF 
Ticker.app is just like a ticker, and is designed in the
dockapp that is supported by X window managers such as Window Maker,
AfterStep, BlackBox, and Enlightenment.

It reads a file that is specified by the command line, and displays each
line in a viewing area periodically. It rereads automatically when the
file has been modified. If you run in a tail-mode, it ticks only the
last line.

Another area to display is a popup window that may be opened by clicking
the up arrow button.

You can skip to next line by clicking the right allow button, and
controll the viewing area by dragging the horizontal scrollbar or the
mouse wheel.
