Image::Size is a library based on the image-sizing code in the 
wwwimagesize script, a tool that analyzes HTML files and adds HEIGHT and 
WIDTH tags to IMG directives. Image::Size has generalized that code to 
return a raw (X, Y) pair, and included wrappers to pre-format that 
output into either HTML or a set of attribute pairs suitable for the 
CGI.pm library by Lincoln Stein.

Currently, Image::Size can size images in XPM, XBM, GIF, JPEG, PNG, MNG, 
TIFF, the PPM family of formats (PPM/PGM/PBM) and if Image::Magick is 
installed, the formats supported by it.
