cat << EOF
The J2000 codec was written in an effort to produce the cleanest and 
simplest implementation possible of the JPEG-2000 standard. We have put 
a particular emphasis on good architecture design and code simplicity, 
while at the same time providing an implementation as complete and 
efficient as possible.
