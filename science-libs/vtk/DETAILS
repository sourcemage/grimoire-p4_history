The Visualization ToolKit (VTK) is an open source, freely available software system for 
3D computer graphics, image processing, and visualization. VTK consists of a C++ class library, 
and several interpreted interface layers including Tcl/Tk, Java, and Python. VTK supports a wide 
variety of visualization algorithms including scalar, vector, tensor, texture, and volumetric 
methods, and advanced modeling techniques such as implicit modelling, polygon reduction, mesh 
smoothing, cutting, contouring, and Delaunay triangulation. In addition, dozens of imaging 
algorithms have been directly integrated to allow the user to mix 2D imaging / 3D graphics 
algorithms and data. The design and implementation of the library has been strongly influenced 
by object-oriented principles.
