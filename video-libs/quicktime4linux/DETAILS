cat << EOF
Quicktime 4 Linux was the first convenient way to read and write uncompressed
Quicktime movies on Linux. Today Quicktime 4 Linux is intended for content
creation and uncompressed movies. These usually arise during the production
phase and not the consumer phase of a movie. It has improvements in colormodel
support, bit depth, accuracy, reliability, and codecs, while not stressing
economy. Users wishing for a consumer library should use OpenQuicktime or
FFMPEG.
