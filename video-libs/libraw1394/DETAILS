libraw1394 provides an API to the Linux IEEE1394 (firewire) driver.
IEEE1394 (firewire) has many uses, one common one is video capture from
a camcorder using dvgrab or kino.  To use this library and any programs
which rely upon it you MUST have the IEEE 1394 kernel driver modules
available.  If you did not select IEEE1394 drivers when you compiled
the kernel, you will want to "cast -r linux" to reconfigure and rebuild
the kernel.  If you rebuild the kernel will want to select the
following, as modules:

[M]   IEEE 1394 (FireWire support)
------------------------------
[M]   Texas Instruments PCILynx support
[M]   OHCI-1394 support
[M]   OHCI-1394 Video support
[M]   SBP-2 support (Harddisks etc.)
[M]   Raw IEEE1394 I/O Support

Finally, you will need to add users authorized to access the IEEE1394
(firewire) hardware to the "firewire" group in /etc/group.
