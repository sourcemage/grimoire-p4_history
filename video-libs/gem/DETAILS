cat << EOF
GEM is the Graphics Environment for Multimedia. It was written by Mark Danks to
generate real-time computer graphics, especially for audio-visual compositions.
Because GEM is a visual programming environment, users do not need any
experience in traditional computer languages.  GEM is a collection of externals
which allow the user to create OpenGL graphics within Pd, a program for
real-time audio processing by Miller Puckette (of Max fame).  GEM currently has
many different shapes and objects, including polygonal graphics, lighting,
texture mapping, image processing, and camera motion. All of this is possible
in real-time without any previous programming experience. Because GEM is an
add-on library for Pd, users can combine audio and graphics, controlling one
medium from another.  Supported in part by a grant from the Intel Research
Council for the The Global Visual Music project of Vibeke Sorensen, Miller
Puckette and Rand Steiger.
