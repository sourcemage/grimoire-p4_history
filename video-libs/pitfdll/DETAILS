cat << EOF
Pitfdll is a GStreamer plugin that allows the use of binary files, such as
Quicktime QTX or Directshow/DMO DLL files, for use as a playback codec in
GStreamer-based media applications. With this plugin, people can playback
proprietary file formats for which no free software implementation exists yet.
