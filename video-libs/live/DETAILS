This code forms a set of C++ libraries for multimedia streaming, using open standard protocols (RTP/RTCP, RTSP, SIP). These libraries - which can be compiled 
for Unix (including Linux and Mac OS X), Windows, and QNX (and other POSIX-compliant systems) - can be used to build streaming applications. The libraries are 
already being used to implement applications such as "liveCaster" and "playRTPMPEG" (for streaming MP3 audio using RTP/RTCP). The libraries can also be used to 
stream, receive, and process MPEG or H.263+ video, and several audio codecs. They can easily be extended to support additional (audio and/or video) codecs, and 
can also be used to build basic RTSP or SIP clients and servers, and have been used to add streaming support to existing media player applications, such as 
"MPlayer".
