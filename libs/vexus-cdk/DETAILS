CDK is a C based curses widget library. CDK sits on top of the curses 
library and provides 21 ready to use widgets for rapid application 
development of text based interfaces. CDK delivers many of the common 
widget types required for a robust interface. Widgets can be combined
to create complex widgets if needed. CDK significantly reduces the
development time of text based application interfaces.
