ClientCookie is a Python module for handling HTTP cookies
on the client side, useful for accessing web sites that
require cookies to be set and then returned later. It also
provides some other (optional) useful stuff: HTTP-EQUIV
handling, zero-time Refresh handling, and lazily-seekable
responses. It has developed from a port ofGisle Aas' Perl
module HTTP::Cookies, from the libwww-perl library.
