libuta is a Graphical User Interface library for C++ that uses SDL (Simple
Directmedia Layer) as its output layer. It allows application and game
programmers to put together portable graphical applications easily. libuta
has a range of already implemented widgets and uses libsigc++ as a signal
dispatching system. It also performs resource management and has a sound
system.
