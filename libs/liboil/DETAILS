           SHORT="Optimized simple functions library for various CPUs"
cat << EOF
Liboil is a library of simple functions that are optimized for various CPUs. 
These functions are generally loops implementing simple algorithms, such as 
converting an array of N integers to floating-poing numbers or multiplying 
and summing an array of N numbers. Clearly such functions are candidates for 
significant optimization using various techniques, especially by using 
extended instructions provided by modern CPUs (Altivec, MMX, SSE, etc.).

Many multimedia applications and libraries already do similar things internally. 
The goal of this project is to consolidate some of the code used by various 
multimedia projects, and also make optimizations easier to use by a broad range 
of applications.

Or rather, that's the goal.

The current status is that much of the infrastructure is developed to determine 
the optimal function to use at runtime. There are a number of existing function 
classes and reference functions (the minimum required for a user-visible 
function). Only a small number of hand-optimized function implementations have 
been added.

Liboil is currently at the cusp of usefullness. If you feel liboil would be 
beneficial to your project, please feel free to encourage me. Additional 
function classes will be added on request.

Liboil requires GCC to build, since it uses GCC extensions heavily. It requires 
GLib-2.0 to build, but not at runtime. Liboil is under the LGPL license.
