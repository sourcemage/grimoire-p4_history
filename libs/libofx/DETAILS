The LibOFX library is a parser and an API designed to allow applications to very easily support OFX command 
responses, usually provided by financial institutions for statement downloads. It is a working OpenSource 
implementation of the OFX (Open Financial eXchange) specification on the client side. This project was first
started with the objective to add OFX support to GnuCash. It since evolved into a generic library, so all
OpenSource Financial software can benefit.
