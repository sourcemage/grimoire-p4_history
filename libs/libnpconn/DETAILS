cat << EOF

Libnpconn - the REAL networkable solution.  Libnpconn makes establishing a
network connection so easy, you'll never use underlying functions ever again.
Automagically, it will establish connections and do all protocol negotiations.
You don't need to know how ANY protocols work, just call the senddata function
on any connection you have open and the library takes care of it.

Features:
  * Thread safe using mutex locks
  * TCP unicast protocol
  * UDP uni and multi-cast protocols
  * Easy development and use
  * LGPL for all those people who want to make proprietary code
