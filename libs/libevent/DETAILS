cat << EOF
The libevent API provides a mechanism to execute a callback function
when a specific event occurs on a file descriptor or after a timeout
has been reached. Furthermore, libevent also support callbacks due to
signals or regular timeouts.
 
libevent is meant to replace the event loop found in event driven
network servers. An application just needs to call event_dispatch()
and then adds or removes events dynamically without having to change
the event loop.
