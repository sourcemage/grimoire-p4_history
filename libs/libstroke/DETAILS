LibStroke is a stroke translation library. Strokes are motions of the
mouse that can be interpreted by a program as a command. Strokes are
used extensively in CAD programs. I fell in love with them when I was
using the CAD tools that use a stroke interface to select tools or
perform actions. I wrote this library so that others can see how
useful strokes can be and so that more programs take advantage of this
extremely natural human-computer interface.
