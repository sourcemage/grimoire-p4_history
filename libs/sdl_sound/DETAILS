           SHORT="SDL library for decoding several sound formats"
cat << EOF
SDL_sound is a library that handles the decoding of several popular
sound file formats, such as .WAV and .MP3. It is meant to make the
programmer's sound playback tasks simpler. The programmer gives
SDL_sound a filename, or feeds it data directly from one of many
sources, and then reads the decoded waveform data back at her leisure.
If resource constraints are a concern, SDL_sound can process sound data
in programmer-specified blocks. Alternately, SDL_sound can decode a
whole sound file and hand back a single pointer to the whole waveform.
SDL_sound can also handle sample rate, audio format, and channel 
conversion on-the-fly and behind-the-scenes, if the programmer desires. 

As the name implies, SDL_sound is an add-on to Simple Directmedia Layer,
and as such, you'll need it to build and use SDL_sound. SDL gives us
lots of convenience for porting and implementing some elements of
the library, not to mention that it is a powerful, cross platform answer
to DirectX. You should definitely look into it, whether you use
SDL_sound or not.
