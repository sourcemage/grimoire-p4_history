cat << EOF
Redland is a library that provides a high-level interface for RDF allowing the RDF graph
to be parsed from XML, stored, queried and manipulated. Redland implements each of the RDF
concepts in its own class via an object based API, reflected into the other language
APIs - Java, Perl, PHP, Python, Ruby and Tcl. Some of the classes providing the parsers,
storage mechanisms and other elements are built as modules that can be added or removed
as required.
