cat << EOF
mysqlcppapi is a C++ wrapper for the MySQL C API library. 

It is a branch of the MySql++ project, but it has diverged significantly for
the following reasons:

* MySQL++ is aggressively optimised for speed, but optimisation should happen
after the design is mature, and that optimisation should be targeted.
Premature optimisation obscures the design and prevents it from improving.

* MySQL++ provides too many ways to do things instead of deciding on an
interface. Again, this obscures the design. 

* MySQL++ uses preprocessor macros to an extent that is unacceptable in a C++
library.
