_very_ bad things happen with this glibc ...
wget can't find any host anymore:
arwed@Otherland:~/wget-1.10.2/src$ ./wget ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/sources/gtk-doc/1.5/gtk-doc-1.5.tar.bz2
--11:59:08--  ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/sources/gtk-doc/1.5/gtk-doc-1.5.tar.bz2
           => `gtk-doc-1.5.tar.bz2'
Resolving ftp.gnome.org... failed: No such file or directory.

Neither can fetchmail:
fetchmail: couldn't find canonical DNS name of pop.gmx.net (pop.gmx.net)

lftpget, mozilla and others work fine
