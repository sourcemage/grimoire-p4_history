	* locales:  Added ru_RU/KOI8-R

2005-07-07 Eric Sandall <eric@sandall.us>
	* DETAILS: Updated headers to 2.6.12.0
	  Removed some trailing whitespaces

2005-07-02 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* BUILD: add --without-__thread to OPTS if building linuxthreads

2005-06-30 Arwed v. Merkatz <v.merkatz@gmx.net>
	* PREPARE: don't allow NPTL glibc on i386, fixes bug #8399

2005-05-18 Arwed v. Merkatz <v.merkatz@gmx.net>
	* BUILD, DEPENDS, DETAILS: use gcc 3.4

2005-05-15 Seth Woolley <seth@tautology.org>
	* PREPARE,BUILD,INSTALL: add fixes for bug 8626,
	  for a pure non-lib64 64-bit system
	* INSTALL: add afrayedknot's install_root fix

2005-05-16 Eric Sandall <eric@sandall.us>
	* BUILD: # Something adds "-O" to CFLAGS so the prior check didn't work
	  Now we just put "-Os" first in CFLAGS so the user's CFLAGS override
	  ours if they want something other than "tiny", however, I noticed that
	  my compile log still shows "-O -Os", so glibc still puts "-O" in even
	  if we already have optimizations, but luckily the let ours override
	  theirs (Fixes Bug #8595)

2005-04-25 Eric Sandall <eric@sandall.us>
	* DETAILS: Updated 2.6 glibc headers to 2.6.11.2
	  Updated UPDATED as these headers fix a compile problem with
	  at least howl (thanks Flintz)

2005-04-11 Eric Sandall <eric@sandall.us>
	* PRE_BUILD: glibcshared.patch now uses -p1
	* glibcshared.patch: Updated for glibc 2.3.5

2005-04-09 Eric Sandall <eric@sandall.us>
	* DETAILS: Updated md5sum for 2.4 version (thanks Andrew)

2005-04-07 Eric Sandall <eric@sandall.us>
	* DETAILS: Updated to 2.3.5
	  Removed MAKE_NJOBS=1
	* BUILD: Run make_single for the entire process

2005-04-07 Eric Sandall <eric@sandall.us>
	* DETAILS: Updated linux-libc-headers to 2.6.11.1
	* HISTORY: Formatted to 80 columns

2005-03-13 Seth Woolley <seth@tautology.org>
	* PRE_INSTALL: support for pure amd64 environment backup

2005-02-19 Arwed v. Merkatz <v.merkatz@gmx.net>
	* CONFLICTS: instead of using 'conflicts glibc-kernel-headers y', just
	  dispel --notriggers glibc-kernel-headers so any remaining glibc
	  triggers aren't executed
	* PRE_BUILD: disable libgd detection/building memusagestat by sediting
	  configure, quick&dirty fix for bug #8277

2005-02-18 Eric Sandall <eric@sandall.us>
	* config.h.patch: Don't say the compilation was aborted when it wasn't

2005-02-18 Arwed v. Merkatz <v.merkatz@gmx.net>
	* TRIGGERS: removed

2005-02-14 Eric Sandall <eric@sandall.us>
	* CONFLICTS: Auto-conflict with deprecated glibc-kernel-headers
	  (Bug #8237)

2005-02-13 Arwed v. Merkatz <v.merkatz@gmx.net>
	* INSTALL: added a workaround for the broken glibc-kernel-headers
	  install on the 0.9.3 iso

2005-02-11 Arwed v. Merkatz <v.merkatz@gmx.net>
	* DETAILS: updated linux-libc-headers to 2.6.10.0

2005-02-09 Eric Sandall <eric@sandall.us>
	* PRE_INSTALL: Don't fail if glibc isn't installed (e.g. install_root)

2005-02-08 Arwed v. Merkatz <v.merkatz@gmx.net>
	* PRE_BUILD, BUILD: set up the 2.4 kernel headers in the correct way

2005-02-06 Arwed v. Merkatz <v.merkatz@gmx.net>
	* INSTALL: fix installation of asm-generic headers for linuxthreads
	  glibc

2005-02-05 Arwed v. Merkatz <v.merkatz@gmx.net>
	* PRE_INSTALL: don't use default_pre_install, sorcerys save_libraries
	  can do harmful things for glibc. PRE_INSTALL now copies all regular
	  files from /lib to $SOURCE_DIRECTORY.bld/old.libs, ldconfig's that
	  dir and then sets up the /lib/{ld-linux.so.2,ld.so.1} link. After
	  that the whole system will use the libraries in
	  $SOURCE_DIRECTORY.bld/old.libs, so dispelling the old glibc works.
	* makelinks: removed, not needed anymore
	* Makefile.patch, PRE_BUILD: patch the main Makefile so glibc doesn't
	  replace /lib/ld-linux.so.2 before running ldconfig

2005-01-29 Arwed v. Merkatz <v.merkatz@gmx.net>
	* BUILD: set CPPFLAGS to include the sanitized headers, fixes building
	  on systems with no kernel headers in /usr/include
	* DETAILS: updated both NPTL and non-NPTL to use the 2.3.4 release
	  tarball
	* locales: de_DE@euro needs ISO-8859-15, not ISO-8859-1
	* PRE_BUILD: always apply glibcshared.patch
	* glibcshared.patch: updated to match the line numbers in this glibc
	* INSTALL: fix generation of UTF8 locales
	* PRE_INSTALL: make /lib/ld-linux.so.2|/lib/ld.so.1 point to the ld.so
	  in the now built glibc so it doesn't break when the old ld.so is
	  removed during dispel

2005-01-08 Eric Sandall <eric@sandall.us>
	* INSTALL: Don't fail if files are left from a prior (possibly
	  untracked or broken) install

2005-01-07 Arwed v. Merkatz <v.merkatz@gmx.net>
	* FINAL: remove $SOURCE_DIRECTORY.bld

2005-01-06 Arwed v. Merkatz <v.merkatz@gmx.net>
	* INSTALL: check GLIBC_UTF variable not UTF for utf-8 locales

2004-12-11 Eric Sandall <eric@sandall.us>
	* DETAILS: Updated NPTL version to 2.3.4
	  Updated non-NPTL version to 2.3.3
	  SOURCE3 removed, SOURCE4 renamed
	  Use CVS_VERSION for the NPTL release
	* PRE_BUILD: SOURCE3 removed, renamed SOURCE4 to SOURCE3
	  Removed application of 2.3.2 gcc 3.3 patch
	* CONFIGURE,INSTALL: Use locales instead of locales-$VERSION
	* locales: Branched from locales-2.3.3 as both versions of glibc now use
	  the locales from 2.3.3+
	* locales-2.3.2,locales-2.3.3: Removed
	* WIP: This new "setup" for glibc fixes some problems on my SPARC and
	  needs to be tested again, sorry about that.

2004-12-10 Eric Sandall <eric@sandall.us>
	* BUILD: More fixes for sparc64 from Gentoo's 2.3.3 ebuild

2004-12-09 Eric Sandall <eric@sandall.us>
	* INSTALL: In case this is a clean install without a prior glibc, setup
	  INSTALL_ROOT/etc/ld.so.conf

2004-11-30 Eric Sandall <eric@sandall.us>
	* BUILD: Need to echo $CFLAGS into grep for it to work
	  Removed all references to CXXFLAGS (glibc has never used C++...)

2004-11-29 Eric Sandall <eric@sandall.us>
	* BUILD: Apply CFLAGS fixes from a Gentoo ebuild for sparc and sparc64.
	  No longer uses echo to remove -ffast-math from CFLAGS.
	  Don't try to use sparc64 headers when building for sparc32 on a
	  sparc64.
	  If building for sparc64, set CC to gcc64, not gcc (untested!).
	* config.h.patch: Instead of removing the #errors, replace them with
	  #warnings to match the spirit of the errors.
	* INSTALL: Force copy in case files/directories exist from a prior,
	  possibly broken, installation.
	  Fix installation of 2.4 headers.
	* CONFIGURE: Don't use config_query, but instead query every time
	  (otherwise you'll always get the menu if you say 'y' and never use
	  '-r' with cast).

2004-11-24 Eric Sandall <eric@sandall.us>
	* CONFIGURE: Removed IFS code and set to use config_query instead of
	  query
	  Removed add_status() and make_locales_checklist()
	* locales-2.3.2,locales-2.3.3: Replaced spaces in all description fields
	  with "_"
	  Removed TABs
	  Added "off" flag for each entry
	  Formatted to look nice. :)
	* HISTORY: Formatted my prior entries to 80 columns

2004-11-23 Eric Sandall <eric@sandall.us>
	* Merging glibc-kernel-headers with glibc (Bug #7560)
	* Removed glibc log cleanup of headers (since it now does install the
	  headers)
	* I have simplified glibc-kernel-headers selection to either install
	  the 2.6 headers if you chose NPTL, or 2.4 headers if you didn't
	  choose NPTL, whereas the prior method allowed you to have 2.6 headers
	  with or without NPTL.
	* DETAILS: Added glibc-kernel-headers for 2.4 and 2.6 kernels
	  Moved DISTCC_HOSTS and MAKE_NJOBS=1 to "global" area
	* BUILD: Use --with-headers= to use included glibc-kernel-headers
	  (Bug #7560)
	  Setup glibc-kernel-headers for compilation (2.4 headers need extra
	  setup)
	  Clean up formatting
	* BUILD,PRE_BUILD: Moved patches from BUILD to PRE_BUILD
	* PRE_BUILD: Merged permission fix from glibc-kernel-headers
	* INSTALL: Added ARCH code
	  Cleaned up formatting
	  Removed MAKE_NJOBS=1
	  Renamed UTF, INPUTFILE, CHARMAP, LOCALE, and DESCRIPTION to be
	  prefixed with GLIBC_
	  Made GLIBC_INPUTFILE, GLIBC_CHARMAP, GLIBC_LOCALE, and
	  GLIBC_DESCRIPTION local variables
	  Install glibc-kernel-headers at the end
	* PREPARE: Remove ldconfig protected hack (Sorcery takes care of this)
	  Renamed UTF and NPTL to GLIBC_UTF and GLIBC_NPTL, respectively
	* DEPENDS: No longer depends on glibc-kernel-headers
	* CONFLICTS: glibc now conflicts with glibc-kernel-headers ;)
	* TRIGGERS: On dispel or cast of glibc-kernel-headers, recast glibc
	  There may be a smarter/better way to do this, but this'll work for now
	* WIP: Removed all verified tests as the "new" glibc needs testing. :)
	  Added "name" field to keep track of who has tested
	* config.h.patch: Fixes xorg (and others) compilation against 2.6
	  Integrated from glibc-kernel-headers
	* makelinks, BUILD, INSTALL, PRE_BUILD, DETAILS: Renamed NPTL to
	  GLIBC_NTPL
	* makelinks: Cleaned up formatting

2004-10-29 Robin Cook <rcook@wyrms.net>
	* BUILD: changed all "$NPTL" = "yes" to $NPTL = "y"
	  changed "$CROSS_INSTALL" = "on" to "$CROSS_INSTALL" == "on"
	  removed section belonging in INSTALL
	* DETAILS: changed all "$NPTL" = "yes" to $NPTL = "y"
	  added BUILD_API=2
	* INSTALL: added with parts from BUILD that belong here
	* makelinks: changed all "$NPTL" = "yes" to $NPTL = "y"
	* PRE_BUILD: changed all "$NPTL" = "no" to $NPTL = "n"
	* PREPARE: changed to using config_query
	* POST_INSTALL: moved to FINAL

2004-10-12 Eric Sandall <eric@sandall.us>
	* DETAILS: Move prerelease comment out of VERSION flag
	  Shortened SHORT
	* HISTORY: Formatted to Guru Handbook

2004-09-15 Wolfgang Scheicher <worf@sbox.tu-graz.ac.at>
	* DETAILS: snapshot 20040907

2004-08-25 Arwed v. Merkatz <v.merkatz@gmx.net>
	* BUILD: only apply glibcshared.patch to the NPTL glibc, bug #7204

2004-07-16 Jose Bernardo Silva <jbernardo@sourcemage.org>
	* glibcshared.patch: added (from gentoo) to fix but #7095
	* BUILD: added patch

2004-07-03 Arwed v. Merkatz <v.merkatz@gmx.net>
	* DETAILS: updated snapshot to 20040628

2004-03-30 Eric Sandall <eric@sandall.us>
	* PREPARE: Extra space typo

2004-03-25 hgg <hgreig@bigpond.net.au>
	* BUILD: adding non-nptl CROSS_INSTALL hacks

2004-03-15 Arwed v. Merkatz <v.merkatz@gmx.net>
	* BUILD: use --enable-kernel=2.6 instead of current for nptl, otherwise
	  prevents you from going back to earlier 2.6 kernels
	* DETAILS: changed UPDATED

2004-03-10 hgg <hgreig@bigpond.net.au>
	* DETAILS: still no official glibc release, but lots of bugfixes in cvs
	* PRE_BUILD: nptl is included in the tarball
	* BUILD: no patching needed for /lib/libc.so.6 to report it's version
	* glibc-nptl-fix-asserts.patch: remove (as above)

2004-02-18 hgg <hgreig@bigpond.net.au>
	* BUILD: fix two typos in my cross_install hack

2004-02-03 hgg <hgreig@bigpond.net.au>
	* BUILD: modify behaviour for CROSS_INSTALL. uses regular paths to
	  compile (or it hardcodes invalid paths) but then installs to
	  INSTALL_ROOT. Works for a x86 -> x86 crossinstall (iso procduction),
	  will work for other "non-cross-compile" crossinstalls. true
	  cross-compiling might need more work.

2004-01-31 hgg <hgreig@bigpond.net.au>
	* DETAILS: update UPDATED, this needs testing by more than sandalle
	  before it can be integrated into test.

2004-01-20 hgg <hgreig@bigponnd.et.au>
	* DEPENDS: remove autoconf
	* BUILD: add export CCACHE_RECACHE=true so ccache users can't be bitten
	  by bug#5570

2004-01-20 hgg <hgreig@bigpond.net.au>
	* BUILD: check for saved libraries (from prepare_install) as an empty
	  install log ruins the whole plan
	* BUILD,CONFIGURE,DEPENDS: remove the headers copying, now depends on a
	  glibc-kernel-headers spell
	* locales-2.3.2,locales-2.3.3: needs seperate locales for each version

2004-01-13 hgg <hgreig@bigpond.net.au>
	* DETAILS: change to use if ... else ... fi
	* BUILD: provide 2nd locale file for 2.3.2 version, move links after
	  prepare_install to a function outside the FIFO and just call the
	  function (much cleaner/ more readable)

2004-01-11 hgg <hgreig@bigpond.net.au>
	* BUILD: ldconfig will relink any alien glibc files in /lib or /usr/lib
	  ldconfig -X stops it relinking them.

2004-01-09 Arwed v. Merkatz <v.merkatz@gmx.net>
	* linux-2.6-header-fix.patch: add another fix, not redefining 'inline'
	  in compiler-gcc3.h

2004-01-04 hgg <hgreig@bigpond.net.au>
	* locales: regenerated from the actual locale files and now using the
	  proper native charset. Now if you want to use UTF-8 for a locale that
	  has it's own native charset, just change LANG to $LANG.UTF-8 in your
	  profile
	* PREPARE,BUILD: ask if user wants UTF-8 locales (to fix bug with gtk+
	  apps) and shuffle the localedef stuff for nicer output, add optional
	  UTF-8 usage, fixes bug #5444
	* BUILD: more symlinks so normal system is maintained during the make
	  install stage

2003-12-23 hgg <hgreig@bigpond.net.au>
	* BUILD: copy the headers immediately after prepare_install
	* BUILD: use the headers from currently running kernel
	* BUILD, linux-2.6-headers-fix.patch: add a few more fixes, appears to
	  be a good fix for fb.h 
	  I have tested with MPlayer SDL(needs an extra flag) directfb , libggi 
	* DETAILS: add sourcemage mirror for the glibc 2.3.2 sscanf patch

2003-12-16 Arwed v. Merkatz <v.merkatz@gmx.net>
	* BUILD: moved --enable-kernel=current to nptl options (breaks
	  compilation for linuxthreads on linux-2.6.0-test11)
	* BUILD, linux-2.6-headers-fix.patch: added patch to fix some kernel
	  headers so they can be included by apps (only videodev.h and
	  videodev2.h so far)
	* locales: added UTF-8 locales

2003-12-15 hgg <hgreig@bigpond.net.au>
	* BUILD: change to use "if ... ; then ... ; fi" after prepare_install 
	  or make install is run even when make has failed. (more of same)
	  I should have thought that through before I tried to make it so lean
	  and clean :(

2003-12-14 hgg <hgreig@bigpond.net.au>
	* DETAILS,PRE_BUILD,BUILD,PREPARE,CONFIGURE: Optional nptl (if running
	  2.6 kernel)
	* DETAILS: nptl build seems to need distcc turned off, in this case
	  better safe than sorry 
	* BUILD: glibc is happiest installing from a few symlinks to the new
	  libraries. BUILD now makes symlinks after prepare_install (while the
	  old libs are still preloaded by sorcery) then reruns ldconfig so only
	  the new version and symbols are used. "make install" then adjusts all
	  symlinks to point to the correct version.
	  Version updates, or even architecture updates should never fail tests
	  or segfault now, "make install" is using the newset libs already
	* glibc-nptl-fix-asserts.patch: A patch so /lib/libc.so.6 will report
	  version strings and compile stats correctly if nptl is built

2003-12-01 Eric Sandall <eric@sandall.us>
	* BUILD: Use INSTALL_ROOT

2003-10-20 Seth Woolley <seth@tautology.org>
	* BUILD, DETAILS: Security fix, downloads patch for grp/initgroups.c
	* HISTORY: new history format

2003-09-29 hgg <hgreig@bigpond.net.au>
	* BUILD: Remove that hack, and edit BUILD to remove the files during
	  prepare_install, re-add the export CC=gcc line needed for new install

2003-09-22 Eric Schabell <eschabell@sourcemage.org>
	* BUILD: Patch for Build file, allows for tracking of two files that
	  were alien in glibc. (fix for iso team).

2003-08-31 hgg <hgreig@bigpond.net.au>
	* TRIGGERS: Remove trigger "on_cast gettext cast_self"

2003-07-23 hgg <hgreig@bigpond.net.au>
	* BUILD: Comment "unset LD_PRELOAD" so locale stuff is tracked (Major
	  version updates might require it later)
	* TRIGGERS: Add to TRIGGERS and update UPDATED in case libiconv is
	  installed then dispelled removing some of glibc's files.

2003-07-08 Eric Sandall <eric@sandall.us>
	* BUILD: Fixes a 'gcc not found' error during configure on some
	  systems

	* PRE_BUILD: pass md5 to unpack.

2002-12-10 Julian v. Bock <julian@wongr.net>
	* CONFIGURE: source $SPELL_CONFIG if the user does not reconfigure
	  locales.

2002-11-16 Julian v. Bock <julian@wongr.net>

	* glibc-2.2.5-weak-alias.patch: add.
	* BUILD: apply patch.
	* PRE_BUILD: remove autoconf stuff.

	* BUILD: escape grep -O option.

2002-01-22 Kyle Sallee <cromwell@metalab.unc.edu>
	* BUILD: Create patch for compiling and installing glibc 2.2.5.
	  Also happy birthday to me.

2002-01-11 Kyle Sallee <cromwell@metalab.unc.edu>
	* BUILD: Added the saving old libs into a directory and exporting
	  LD_LIBRARY_PATH with that directory.
	  This should keep the make install from breaking.
