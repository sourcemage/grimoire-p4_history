	* PREPARE: Extra space typo

2004-03-25 hgg <hgreig@bigpond.net.au>
	* BUILD: adding non-nptl CROSS_INSTALL hacks

2004-03-15 Arwed v. Merkatz <v.merkatz@gmx.net>
	* BUILD: use --enable-kernel=2.6 instead of current for nptl, otherwise
	prevents you from going back to earlier 2.6 kernels
	* DETAILS: changed UPDATED

2004-03-10 hgg <hgreig@bigpond.net.au>
	* DETAILS: still no official glibc release, but lots of bugfixes in cvs
	* PRE_BUILD: nptl is included in the tarball
	* BUILD: no patching needed for /lib/libc.so.6 to report it's version
	* glibc-nptl-fix-asserts.patch: remove (as above)

2004-02-18 hgg <hgreig@bigpond.net.au>
	* BUILD: fix two typos in my cross_install hack

2004-02-03 hgg <hgreig@bigpond.net.au>
	* BUILD: modify behaviour for CROSS_INSTALL. uses regular paths to compile (or it hardcodes invalid paths)
	but then installs to INSTALL_ROOT. Works for a x86 -> x86 crossinstall (iso procduction), will work for other 
	"non-cross-compile" crossinstalls. true cross-compiling might need more work.

2004-01-31 hgg <hgreig@bigpond.net.au>
	* DETAILS: update UPDATED, this needs testing by more than sandalle before it can be integrated into test.

2004-01-20 hgg <hgreig@bigponnd.et.au>
	* DEPENDS: remove autoconf
	* BUILD: add export CCACHE_RECACHE=true so ccache users can't be bitten by bug#5570

2004-01-20 hgg <hgreig@bigpond.net.au>
	* BUILD: check for saved libraries (from prepare_install) as an empty install log ruins the whole plan
	* BUILD,CONFIGURE,DEPENDS: remove the headers copying, now depends on a glibc-kernel-headers spell
	* locales-2.3.2,locales-2.3.3: needs seperate locales for each version
	
2004-01-13 hgg <hgreig@bigpond.net.au>
	* DETAILS: change to use if ... else ... fi
	* BUILD: provide 2nd locale file for 2.3.2 version, move links after prepare_install to a function outside 
	the FIFO and just call the function (much cleaner/ more readable)
	
2004-01-11 hgg <hgreig@bigpond.net.au>
	* BUILD: ldconfig will relink any alien glibc files in /lib or /usr/lib
	ldconfig -X stops it relinking them.

2004-01-09 Arwed v. Merkatz <v.merkatz@gmx.net>
	* linux-2.6-header-fix.patch: add another fix, not redefining 'inline'
	in compiler-gcc3.h

2004-01-04 hgg <hgreig@bigpond.net.au>
	* locales: regenerated from the actual locale files and now using the proper native charset.
	Now if you want to use UTF-8 for a locale that has it's own native charset, just change LANG to $LANG.UTF-8 in your profile
	* PREPARE,BUILD: ask if user wants UTF-8 locales (to fix bug with gtk+ apps) and
	shuffle the localedef stuff for nicer output, add optional UTF-8 usage , fixes bug #5444
	* BUILD: more symlinks so normal system is maintained during the make install stage
	
2003-12-23 hgg <hgreig@bigpond.net.au>
	* BUILD: copy the headers immediately after prepare_install
	* BUILD: use the headers from currently running kernel
	* BUILD, linux-2.6-headers-fix.patch: add a few more fixes, appears to be a good fix for fb.h 
	I have tested with MPlayer SDL(needs an extra flag) directfb , libggi 
	* DETAILS: add sourcemage mirror for the glibc 2.3.2 sscanf patch

2003-12-16 Arwed v. Merkatz <v.merkatz@gmx.net>
	* BUILD: moved --enable-kernel=current to nptl options (breaks
	compilation for linuxthreads on linux-2.6.0-test11)
	* BUILD, linux-2.6-headers-fix.patch: added patch to fix some kernel
	headers so they can be included by apps (only videodev.h and videodev2.h
	so far)
	* locales: added UTF-8 locales

2003-12-15 hgg <hgreig@bigpond.net.au>
	* BUILD: change to use "if ... ; then ... ; fi" after prepare_install 
	or make install is run even when make has failed. (more of same)
	I should have thought that through before I tried to make it so lean and clean :(
	

2003-12-14 hgg <hgreig@bigpond.net.au>
	* DETAILS,PRE_BUILD,BUILD,PREPARE,CONFIGURE: Optional nptl (if running 2.6 kernel)
	* DETAILS: nptl build seems to need distcc turned off, in this case better safe than sorry 
	* BUILD: glibc is happiest installing from a few symlinks to the new libraries. BUILD now makes symlinks after 
	prepare_install (while the old libs are still preloaded by sorcery) then reruns ldconfig 
	so only the new version and symbols are used. "make install" then adjusts all symlinks to point to the correct version.
	Version updates, or even architecture updates  should never fail tests or segfault now, 
	"make install" is using the newset libs already, 
	* glibc-nptl-fix-asserts.patch: A patch so /lib/libc.so.6 will report version strings and compile stats 
	correctly if nptl is built

2003-12-01 Eric Sandall <eric@sandall.us>
	* BUILD: Use INSTALL_ROOT

2003-10-20 Seth Woolley <seth@tautology.org>
	* BUILD, DETAILS: Security fix, downloads patch for grp/initgroups.c
	* HISTORY: new history format

2003-09-29 hgg <hgreig@bigpond.net.au>
	* BUILD: Remove that hack, and edit BUILD to remove the files 
	during prepare_install, re-add the export CC=gcc line 
	needed for new install

2003-09-22 Eric D. Schabell <eschabell@sourcemage.org>
	* BUILD: Patch for Build file, allows for tracking of two files
	that were alien in glibc. (fix for iso team).

2003-08-31 hgg <hgreig@bigpond.net.au>
	* TRIGGERS: Remove trigger "on_cast  gettext cast_self"

2003-07-23 hgg <hgreig@bigpond.net.au>
	* BUILD: Comment "unset LD_PRELOAD" so locale stuff is tracked
	(Major version updates might require it later)
	* TRIGGERS: Add to TRIGGERS and update UPDATED in case libiconv
	is installed then dispelled removing some of glibc's files.

2003-07-08 Eric Sandall <eric@sandall.us>

2002-01-11 Kyle Sallee <cromwell@metalab.unc.edu>
	* BUILD: Added the saving old libs into a directory and 
	exporting LD_LIBRARY_PATH with that directory. 
	This should keep the make install from breaking.
