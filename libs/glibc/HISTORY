2004-11-24 Eric Sandall <eric@sandall.us>
	* CONFIGURE: Removed IFS code and set to use config_query instead of query
	  Removed add_status() and make_locales_checklist()
	* locales-2.3.2,locales-2.3.3: Replaced spaces in all description fields
	  with "_"
	  Removed TABs
	  Added "off" flag for each entry
	  Formatted to look nice. :)
	* HISTORY: Formatted my prior entries to 80 columns

2004-11-23 Eric Sandall <eric@sandall.us>
	* Merging glibc-kernel-headers with glibc  (Bug #7560)
	* Removed glibc log cleanup of headers (since it now does install the
	  headers)
	* I have simplified glibc-kernel-headers selection to either install the 2.6
	  headers if you chose NPTL, or 2.4 headers if you didn't choose NPTL,
	  whereas the prior method allowed you to have 2.6 headers with or without
	  NPTL.
	* DETAILS: Added glibc-kernel-headers for 2.4 and 2.6 kernels
	  Moved DISTCC_HOSTS and MAKE_NJOBS=1 to "global" area
	* BUILD: Use --with-headers= to use included glibc-kernel-headers
	  (Bug #7560)
	  Setup glibc-kernel-headers for compilation (2.4 headers need extra setup)
	  Clean up formatting
	* BUILD,PRE_BUILD: Moved patches from BUILD to PRE_BUILD
	* PRE_BUILD: Merged permission fix from glibc-kernel-headers
	* INSTALL: Added ARCH code
	  Cleaned up formatting
	  Removed MAKE_NJOBS=1
	  Renamed UTF, INPUTFILE, CHARMAP, LOCALE, and DESCRIPTION to be prefixed
	  with GLIBC_
	  Made GLIBC_INPUTFILE, GLIBC_CHARMAP, GLIBC_LOCALE, and GLIBC_DESCRIPTION
	  local variables
	  Install glibc-kernel-headers at the end
	* PREPARE: Remove ldconfig protected hack (Sorcery takes care of this)
	  Renamed UTF and NPTL to GLIBC_UTF and GLIBC_NPTL, respectively
	* DEPENDS: No longer depends on glibc-kernel-headers
	* CONFLICTS: glibc now conflicts with glibc-kernel-headers ;)
	* TRIGGERS: On dispel or cast of glibc-kernel-headers, recast glibc
	  There may be a smarter/better way to do this, but this'll work for now
	* WIP: Removed all verified tests as the "new" glibc needs testing. :)
	  Added "name" field to keep track of who has tested
	* config.h.patch: Fixes xorg (and others) compilation against 2.6
	  Integrated from glibc-kernel-headers
	* makelinks, BUILD, INSTALL, PRE_BUILD, DETAILS: Renamed NPTL to GLIBC_NTPL
	* makelinks: Cleaned up formatting

2004-10-29 Robin Cook <rcook@wyrms.net>
	* BUILD: changed all "$NPTL" = "yes" to $NPTL = "y"
	  changed "$CROSS_INSTALL" = "on" to "$CROSS_INSTALL" == "on"
	  removed section belonging in INSTALL
	* DETAILS: changed all "$NPTL" = "yes" to $NPTL = "y"
	  added BUILD_API=2
	* INSTALL: added with parts from BUILD that belong here
	* makelinks: changed all "$NPTL" = "yes" to $NPTL = "y"
	* PRE_BUILD: changed all "$NPTL" = "no" to $NPTL = "n"
	* PREPARE: changed to using config_query
	* POST_INSTALL: moved to FINAL

2004-10-12 Eric Sandall <eric@sandall.us>
	* DETAILS: Move prerelease comment out of VERSION flag
	  Shortened SHORT
	* HISTORY: Formatted to Guru Handbook

2004-09-15 Wolfgang Scheicher <worf@sbox.tu-graz.ac.at>
	* DETAILS: snapshot 20040907

2004-08-25 Arwed v. Merkatz <v.merkatz@gmx.net>
	* BUILD: only apply glibcshared.patch to the NPTL glibc, bug #7204

2004-07-16 Jose Bernardo Silva <jbernardo@sourcemage.org>
	* glibcshared.patch: added (from gentoo) to fix but #7095
	* BUILD: added patch

2004-07-03 Arwed v. Merkatz <v.merkatz@gmx.net>
	* DETAILS: updated snapshot to 20040628

2004-03-30 Eric Sandall <eric@sandall.us>
	* PREPARE: Extra space typo

2004-03-25 hgg <hgreig@bigpond.net.au>
	* BUILD: adding non-nptl CROSS_INSTALL hacks

2004-03-15 Arwed v. Merkatz <v.merkatz@gmx.net>
	* BUILD: use --enable-kernel=2.6 instead of current for nptl, otherwise
	  prevents you from going back to earlier 2.6 kernels
	* DETAILS: changed UPDATED

2004-03-10 hgg <hgreig@bigpond.net.au>
	* DETAILS: still no official glibc release, but lots of bugfixes in cvs
	* PRE_BUILD: nptl is included in the tarball
	* BUILD: no patching needed for /lib/libc.so.6 to report it's version
	* glibc-nptl-fix-asserts.patch: remove (as above)

2004-02-18 hgg <hgreig@bigpond.net.au>
	* BUILD: fix two typos in my cross_install hack

2004-02-03 hgg <hgreig@bigpond.net.au>
	* BUILD: modify behaviour for CROSS_INSTALL. uses regular paths to compile
	  (or it hardcodes invalid paths) but then installs to INSTALL_ROOT. Works
	  for a x86 -> x86 crossinstall (iso procduction), will work for other 
	  "non-cross-compile" crossinstalls. true cross-compiling might need more
	  work.

2004-01-31 hgg <hgreig@bigpond.net.au>
	* DETAILS: update UPDATED, this needs testing by more than sandalle before
	  it can be integrated into test.

2004-01-20 hgg <hgreig@bigponnd.et.au>
	* DEPENDS: remove autoconf
	* BUILD: add export CCACHE_RECACHE=true so ccache users can't be bitten by
	  bug#5570

2004-01-20 hgg <hgreig@bigpond.net.au>
	* BUILD: check for saved libraries (from prepare_install) as an empty
	  install log ruins the whole plan
	* BUILD,CONFIGURE,DEPENDS: remove the headers copying, now depends on a
	  glibc-kernel-headers spell
	* locales-2.3.2,locales-2.3.3: needs seperate locales for each version

2004-01-13 hgg <hgreig@bigpond.net.au>
	* DETAILS: change to use if ... else ... fi
	* BUILD: provide 2nd locale file for 2.3.2 version, move links after
	  prepare_install to a function outside the FIFO and just call the function
	  (much cleaner/ more readable)

2004-01-11 hgg <hgreig@bigpond.net.au>
	* BUILD: ldconfig will relink any alien glibc files in /lib or /usr/lib
	  ldconfig -X stops it relinking them.

2004-01-09 Arwed v. Merkatz <v.merkatz@gmx.net>
	* linux-2.6-header-fix.patch: add another fix, not redefining 'inline' in
	  compiler-gcc3.h

2004-01-04 hgg <hgreig@bigpond.net.au>
	* locales: regenerated from the actual locale files and now using the proper
	  native charset.  Now if you want to use UTF-8 for a locale that has it's
	  own native charset, just change LANG to $LANG.UTF-8 in your profile
	* PREPARE,BUILD: ask if user wants UTF-8 locales (to fix bug with gtk+ apps)
	  and shuffle the localedef stuff for nicer output, add optional UTF-8
	  usage, fixes bug #5444
	* BUILD: more symlinks so normal system is maintained during the make
	  install stage

2003-12-23 hgg <hgreig@bigpond.net.au>
	* BUILD: copy the headers immediately after prepare_install
	* BUILD: use the headers from currently running kernel
	* BUILD, linux-2.6-headers-fix.patch: add a few more fixes, appears to be a
	  good fix for fb.h 
	  I have tested with MPlayer SDL(needs an extra flag) directfb , libggi 
	* DETAILS: add sourcemage mirror for the glibc 2.3.2 sscanf patch

2003-12-16 Arwed v. Merkatz <v.merkatz@gmx.net>
	* BUILD: moved --enable-kernel=current to nptl options (breaks
	  compilation for linuxthreads on linux-2.6.0-test11)
	* BUILD, linux-2.6-headers-fix.patch: added patch to fix some kernel
	  headers so they can be included by apps (only videodev.h and videodev2.h
	  so far)
	* locales: added UTF-8 locales

2003-12-15 hgg <hgreig@bigpond.net.au>
	* BUILD: change to use "if ... ; then ... ; fi" after prepare_install 
	  or make install is run even when make has failed. (more of same)
	  I should have thought that through before I tried to make it so lean and
	  clean :(

2003-12-14 hgg <hgreig@bigpond.net.au>
	* DETAILS,PRE_BUILD,BUILD,PREPARE,CONFIGURE: Optional nptl (if running 2.6
	  kernel)
	* DETAILS: nptl build seems to need distcc turned off, in this case better
	  safe than sorry 
	* BUILD: glibc is happiest installing from a few symlinks to the new
	  libraries. BUILD now makes symlinks after prepare_install (while the old
	  libs are still preloaded by sorcery) then reruns ldconfig so only the new
	  version and symbols are used. "make install" then adjusts all symlinks to
	  point to the correct version.
	  Version updates, or even architecture updates should never fail tests or
	  segfault now, "make install" is using the newset libs already, 
	* glibc-nptl-fix-asserts.patch: A patch so /lib/libc.so.6 will report
	  version strings and compile stats correctly if nptl is built

2003-12-01 Eric Sandall <eric@sandall.us>
	* BUILD: Use INSTALL_ROOT

2003-10-20 Seth Woolley <seth@tautology.org>
	* BUILD, DETAILS: Security fix, downloads patch for grp/initgroups.c
	* HISTORY: new history format

2003-09-29 hgg <hgreig@bigpond.net.au>
	* BUILD: Remove that hack, and edit BUILD to remove the files during
	  prepare_install, re-add the export CC=gcc line needed for new install

2003-09-22 Eric D. Schabell <eschabell@sourcemage.org>
	* BUILD: Patch for Build file, allows for tracking of two files that were
	  alien in glibc. (fix for iso team).

2003-08-31 hgg <hgreig@bigpond.net.au>
	* TRIGGERS: Remove trigger "on_cast gettext cast_self"

2003-07-23 hgg <hgreig@bigpond.net.au>
	* BUILD: Comment "unset LD_PRELOAD" so locale stuff is tracked (Major
	  version updates might require it later)
	* TRIGGERS: Add to TRIGGERS and update UPDATED in case libiconv is installed
	  then dispelled removing some of glibc's files.

2003-07-08 Eric Sandall <eric@sandall.us>
	* BUILD: Fixes a 'gcc not found' error during configure on some
	  systems

	* BUILD: Create patch for compiling and installing glibc 2.2.5.
	  Also happy birthday to me.

2002-01-11 Kyle Sallee <cromwell@metalab.unc.edu>
	* BUILD: Added the saving old libs into a directory and exporting
	  LD_LIBRARY_PATH with that directory.
	  This should keep the make install from breaking.
