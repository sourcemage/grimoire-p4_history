cat << EOF
annie is an ANN, ie, Artificial Neural Network library developed in C++. It can be used 
to implement various kinds of neural networks like Multi-Layer Perceptron, Radial basis 
function networks, Hopfield networks etc.

To avoid possible conflict with any other library that you may be using, all classes 
here are packaged into a namespace annie.

This library is intended to be ideal for beginners who need to use neural networks in 
some particular application, and want to concentrate on the application rather than the 
network implementation itself, so such users can treat this library as a black-box, not 
worrying about how it's working.

You can also download the Matlab Extensions Pack from the website 
(annie.sourceforge.net), which will help you use the features of Matlab to train and 
modify networks and yet be able to use them in your C++ programs.
