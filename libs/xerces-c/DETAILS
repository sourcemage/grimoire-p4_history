           SHORT="Xerces-C++ is a validating XML parser"
cat << EOF
Xerces-C++ is a validating XML parser written in a portable subset 
of C++. Xerces-C++ makes it easy to give your application the ability
to read and write XML data. A shared library is provided for parsing,
generating, manipulating, and validating XML documents.

Xerces-C++ is faithful to the XML 1.0 recommendation and many associated
standards. The parser provides high performance, modularity, and 
scalability. Source code, samples and API documentation are provided with 
the parser. For portability, care has been taken to make minimal use of 
templates, no RTTI, and minimal use of #ifdefs.
