cat << EOF
neon is an HTTP and WebDAV client library, with a C interface. Featuring:

*	High-level interface to HTTP and WebDAV methods (PUT, GET, HEAD etc);
*	Low-level interface to HTTP request handling, to allow implementing new
	methods easily;
*	persistent connections;
*	RFC2617 basic and digest authentication (including auth-int, md5-sess);
*	Proxy support (including basic/digest authentication);
*	SSL/TLS support using OpenSSL (including client certificate support);
*	Generic WebDAV 207 XML response handling mechanism;
*	XML parsing using the expat or libxml parsers;
*	Easy generation of error messages from 207 error responses;
*	WebDAV resource manipulation: MOVE, COPY, DELETE, MKCOL;
*	WebDAV metadata support: set and remove properties, query any set of
	properties (PROPPATCH/PROPFIND);
*	autoconf macros supplied for easily embedding neon directly inside an
	application source tree.
