TC2 is library for writing modular programs. A TC2 application consists of a
set of modules, each implementing one or more separately defined interfaces.
When a module uses a function defined by some interface, a module implementing
that interface is automatically loaded. TC2 keeps track of dependencies between
modules and automatically unloads modules when they are no longer required, as
well as preventing unloading of modules in use.
