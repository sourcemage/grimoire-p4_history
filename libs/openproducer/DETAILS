cat << EOF
Open Producer (or simply Producer) is a cross-platform, C++ library for managing OpenGL rendering 
contexts in a windowing system independent manner.  Producer provides a simple, yet powerfully 
scalable approach for real-time 3D applications wishing to run within a single window to large, 
multidisplay systems.
 Producer is highly  portable and has been tested on Linux, Windows, Mac OSX, Solaris and IRIX.  
Producer works on all Unix based OS's (including Mac OSX) through the X11 Windowing system, and 
through the native win32 on Windows.
 Producer is written with productivity, performance and scalability in mind by adhering to industry 
standard and employing advanced software engineering practices.  Software developers wishing to 
produce 3D rendering software that can display on a desktop, and move to a large system or clustered 
system of displays by simply changing a configuration file, can depend on Open Producer to handle all 
the complexity for them.
