    UCL is a portable lossless data compression library written in
ANSI C.

    UCL implements a number of compression algorithms that achieve an 
excellent compression ratio while allowing *very* fast decompression. 
Decompression requires no additional memory.

    UCL is my OpenSource re-implementation of some NRV compression
algorithms.

    As compared to LZO, the UCL algorithms achieve a better
compression ratio but decompression is a little bit slower. See below 
for some rough timings.
