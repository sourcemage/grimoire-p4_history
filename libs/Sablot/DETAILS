Sablotron is a fast, compact and portable XML toolkit implementing
XSLT, DOM and XPath. Sablotron is an open project; other users and
developers are encouraged to use it or to help us testing or improving
it. The goal of this project is to create a lightweight, reliable and
fast XML library processor conforming to the W3C specification, which
is available for public and can be used as a base for multi-platform
XML applications.
