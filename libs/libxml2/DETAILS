cat << EOF
The libXML library allows you to manipulate XML files. It offers SAX or
DOM tree generation interfaces. It supports XML and HTML (real world
ones) parsing, flexible DTD validation, XPath, XPointer-XInclude, and
pull and push modes with FTP and HTTP modules. It's written in C and
should be fairly portable. The design is modular; most of the extensions
can be compiled out.
