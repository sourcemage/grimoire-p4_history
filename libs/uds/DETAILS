The UDS (Useful Development Stuff) Collection is a C++ library that
provides development and debugging facilities such as automatic
searching for memory leaks and zombie objects, backtraces at runtime,
an alternative set of function objects, classes for reference
counting, copy-on-write and garbage collection, POSIX threads wrapper
classes, a socket API that includes support for TCP, UDP, X.25, and
Unix domain sockets, m4 macros, and much more.
