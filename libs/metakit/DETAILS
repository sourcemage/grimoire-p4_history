cat << EOF
MetaKit is an efficient database library with a small footprint. It
fills the gap between flat-file, relational databases, and OODBMS. It 
features structured storage, transacted commit, on-demand loading and 
portability. It runs on Unix, Windows 3/95/NT, Mac, VMS and BeOS, and 
includes interfaces for C++, Python, and TCL.
