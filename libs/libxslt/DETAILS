cat << EOF
Libxslt is a C library for GNOME which allows developers to work with XSLT. It
is based on libxml for XML parsing, tree manipulation, and XPath support. It
is written in plain C, making as few assumptions as possible, and sticking
closely to ANSI C/POSIX for easy embedding. It should work on Linux, Unix, and
Windows. Though not designed primarily with performances in mind, libxslt
seems to be a relatively fast processor.
