cat << EOF
The ADAPTIVE Communication Environment (ACE) is a freely available, 
open-source object-oriented (OO) framework that implements many core 
patterns for concurrent communication software. ACE provides a rich 
set of reusable C++ wrapper facades and framework components that perform 
common communication software tasks across a range of OS platforms. 
The communication software tasks provided by ACE include event 
demultiplexing and event handler dispatching, signal handling, service 
initialization, interprocess communication, shared memory management, 
message routing, dynamic (re)configuration of distributed services, 
concurrent execution and synchronization. 

ACE is targeted for developers of high-performance and real-time 
communication services and applications. It simplifies the development 
of OO network applications and services that utilize interprocess 
communication, event demultiplexing, explicit dynamic linking, and 
concurrency. In addition, ACE automates system configuration and 
reconfiguration by dynamically linking services into applications at 
run-time and executing these services in one or more processes or threads. 

Notes:
	This is a massive communications framework, so be aware that building 
	this software library does take a considerable amount of time. Install
	and cache are +/-65M.
