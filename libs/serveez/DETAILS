cat << EOF
Serveez is a server framework. It provides routines and help for
implementing IP based servers (currently TCP, UDP and ICMP). It is also
possible to use named pipes for all connection oriented protocols.
We think it is worth the effort because many people need server functionality
within their applications. However, many people experience problems 
with select()- or poll()-loops and non-blocking operations.
This application demonstrates various aspects of advanced network
programming in a portable manner.
