cat << EOF
Liboop is a low-level event loop management library for POSIX-based operating systems. 
It supports the development of modular, multiplexed applications which may respond to events 
from several sources. It replaces the "select() loop" and allows the registration of event handlers 
for file and network I/O, timers and signals. Since processes use these mechanisms for almost all 
external communication, liboop can be used as the basis for almost any application.
