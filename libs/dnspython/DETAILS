cat << EOF
dnspython is a DNS toolkit for Python. It supports all of the common
record types and will support all types. It can be used for queries,
zone transfers, and dynamic updates.  It supports TSIG authenticated
messages and EDNS0.
dnspython provides both high and low level access to DNS. The high
level classes perform queries for data of a given name, type, and
class, and return an answer set.  The low level classes allow direct
manipulation of DNS zones, messages, names, and records.
