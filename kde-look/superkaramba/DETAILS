SuperKaramba is, in simple terms, a tool that allows you to easily 
create interactive eye-candy on your KDE desktop. Currently, only linux 
is officially supported. 

How does it work?

Theme writers create themes, or text files that define their widget. 
Then, they can optionally add python scripting to make their widget 
interactive. The possibilities are endless! 

Here are just some examples of the things that can be done: 
* Display system information such as CPU Usage, MP3 playing, etc.
* Create cool custom toolbars that work any way imaginable
* Create little games or virtual pets that live on your desktop
* Display information from the internet, such as weather and headlines

Themes can be found at http://www.kdelook.org or downloaded within the Superkaramba interface.
