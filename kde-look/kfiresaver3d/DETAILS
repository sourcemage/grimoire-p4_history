KFiresaver3D, is a project originated from the great work that is David
Sansome's kfiresaver. For those who already tried previous versions, let's say
that the screensaver is improved so much. Now there is a setup dialog (thanks
David) whith tons of options to fully configure the screensaver and adapt it to
your needs! I've also added a 'shading' effect, sound, gFX, the possibility to
use presets for options and many other things...
