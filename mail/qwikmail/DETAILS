Qwikmail is a lightweight, simple and easy to configure Mail-Transport Agent.

It's suitable for local delivery only and remote delivery.

The configuration file is really easy to setup (a few lines).

This mailer daemon is recomended if you don't know much about how email works, or if you need local delivery only (not connected to the Internet).
