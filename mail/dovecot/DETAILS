Overview

Dovecot is an IMAP server for Linux/UNIX-like systems, written with security primarily in mind. Although it's written with C, it uses several coding techniques to avoid most of the common pitfalls. Next release will also contain a small POP3 server.

Dovecot can work with standard mbox and maildir formats and it's fully compatible with UW-IMAP and Courier IMAP servers as well as mail clients accessing the mailboxes directly. I have also plans to support storing mails in SQL databases.

Dovecot is easy to set up and doesn't require special maintenance. Only thing you need is to get the authentication working properly - if your users are in /etc/passwd there's hardly anything you have to do.

Dovecot should be pretty fast. There's still some optimizations that could be done, but I believe it already beats most other IMAP servers in overall performance. This is mostly because of index files that Dovecot maintains; instead of having to scan through all the data in mailbox, Dovecot can get most of the wanted information from index with little effort. Dovecot's indexes can scale to huge amount of messages per mailbox with hardly any noticeable slowdown. I've tested only up to 367000 mails, but millions of messages should be no problem.

Dovecot takes very little memory. Most of it goes to mmap()ed index and mailbox files, meaning that if operating system is low on memory, it can simply drop those memory pages without having to store them in swap. Connections are handled in a separate processes, each one currently using something like 100-200kB of swappable memory. Some extensions like SORT and THREAD will require more memory to work though.

Dovecot is fail safe. Indexes could potentially be quite a large problem maker, but Dovecot does sanity checks to all data before using it to avoid crashes and other problems. Any kind of crash is considered as bug and will be fixed - even if it happens only by deliberately poking the index files.
Status

    * Dovecot should be quite ready for use with normal IMAP clients.
    * Complete IMAP4rev1 support.
    * Supports THREAD and SORT extensions, required by many IMAP webmails.
    * Complete TLS/SSL support, using either GNUTLS or OpenSSL.
    * IPv6 ready.
    * Shared mailboxes aren't yet supported.
    * Maildir++ quota isn't yet supported.
    * mbox support still has a few problems, especially related to copying messages from mailbox to another. If you're not planning on doing that, it should work fine.
    * Message UIDs aren't yet permanently stored - in case index needs to be rebuilt they're lost. This probably isn't a problem with most clients, only those that associate some extra data with UIDs.
    * Authentication configuration is somewhat lacking. We don't directly yet support LDAP or SQL as user database, but it's possible using vpopmail. I'll probably add support for Cyrus SASL library as well. (Next version will very likely contain LDAP and SQL support.)
