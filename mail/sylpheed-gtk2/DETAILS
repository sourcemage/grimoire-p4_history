Sylpheed-gtk2 is a GTK2 port of Sylpheed. Sylpheed-gtk2 is a GTK2 based, lightweight, and fast email client. Almost all commands are accessible with the keyboard. It also has many features such as multiple accounts, POP3/APOP support, thread display, and multipart MIME. One of Sylpheed's future goals is to be fully internationalized. The messages are managed in the MH format, so you'll be able to use it together with another mailer that uses the MH format.
