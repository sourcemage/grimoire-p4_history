Amavis-new is a high-performance interface between mailer (MTA)
and content checkers: virus scanners, and/or SpamAssassin.
It is written in Perl for maintainability, without paying a significant
price for speed. It talks to MTA via (E)SMTP or LMTP, or by using
helper programs. Best with Postfix, fine with dual-sendmail setup and
Exim v4, works with sendmail/milter, or with any MTA as a SMTP relay.
For Courier and qmail MTA there is a patch in the distributed package.
