This is a draft rewrite of the mutt spell.  It supports all 3 branches and has
a basic patch framework.  It passes the test casts I've thrown at it, but it
could use some more testing before it goes to test.

Work to be done:
- The patches should get downloaded and md5summed, etc.  I also need to replace
  the directory name-based ordering with a simple ordered list to simplify
  ongoing maintenance.  I'll probably work on this next.
- Patches tend to trample each other.  The ones here work together with a bit
  of tweaking I've done, but there are others yet to be added that may require
  a more extensive patch framework.  I wanted to avoid going too far on that
  since other spells are working on similar things already, but I'll be looking
  to support more patches and may need to extend it for those.
- There are a few temporary pieces of code to move old variables to the new
  functionality; those pieces will need to get removed eventually.
- It may be worth adding a README to the patches/ directory.
- There are some more potential optional_depends: urlview, muttzilla, lbdb,
  abook, MAIL-TRANSPORT-AGENT.  Most of these don't even have spells yet...
- gpgme support doesn't seem to work but I think that's probably a version
  mismatch (need devel gpgme), will test later.
