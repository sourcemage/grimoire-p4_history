cat << EOF
The Anomy mail sanitizer is a filter designed to block
email-based security risks, such as trojans and viruses. It
can scan an arbitrarily complex RFC822 or MIME message and
remove or rename attachments, truncate unusually long MIME
header fields and sanitize HTML by disabling Javascript,
etc. It uses a single-pass pure Perl MIME parser, which can
make it both more efficient and more precise than other
similar programs. The sanitizer has built-in support for
third-party virus scanners.
