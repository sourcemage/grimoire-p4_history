Currently working on converting this spell over to a diel version spell for GTK and GTK2 purposes

Spell is created, but going back now and taking another look at things. I found that using a hyphen in the variable name 
is inadvertantly a bad thing to do. So, I went back and replaced the hyphens with underscores. The spell not seems to be 
asking currectly, and setting dependancies right depending on the answer. The only thing that is throwing it at the 
moment is that it still seems to be going for the old version. I am just not seeing what could be causing this at the 
moment and am going to go back and take another look at it in a bit.
