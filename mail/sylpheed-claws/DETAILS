Purpose
The main reason for this bleeding edge branch is to lift some of the burden from the shoulders of Hiroyuki Yamamoto, Sylpheed's creator. The idea is that we regularly resync with Hiroyuki's main branch, and vice-versa.
 
Usage
Input from users is welcome, but if you want stability use Hiroyuki's stable branch.
If you're curious which features could end up in the stable branch, or if you like testing/crashing things a lot try this bleeding edge branch.

About Sylpheed & Sylpheed-Claws
Sylpheed is an e-mail client (and news reader) based on GTK+, running on X Window System, and aiming for

    Quick response
    Graceful, and sophisticated interface
    Easy configuration, intuitive operation
    Abundant features

The appearance and interface are similar to some popular e-mail clients for Windows, such as Outlook Express, Becky!, and Datula. The interface is also designed to emulate the mailers on Emacsen, and almost all commands are accessible with the keyboard.

The messages are managed in MH format, and you'll be able to use it together with another mailer based on MH format (like Mew). You can also utilize fetchmail and/or procmail, and external programs on receiving (like inc or imget).
