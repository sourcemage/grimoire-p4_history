cat << EOF
DSPAM is a server-side statistical anti-spam agent for Unix email servers. It masquerades
as the email server's local delivery agent and effectively filters spam using a combination
of de-obfuscation techniques, specialized algorithms, and statistical analysis. The result
is an administratively maintenance-free, self-learning anti-spam tool. DSPAM has yielded
real-world success rates beyond 99.9% accuracy with less than a 0.01% chance of false
positives.
