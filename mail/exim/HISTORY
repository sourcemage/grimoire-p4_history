	exim 3.34, kongar

    	- corrected a typo in POST_INSTALL which was a bug,
    	disabling fcrons exim line

    	- added EXIM_UID=`id -u mail` and EXIM_GID=`id -g mail` to the BUILD.  
   	Also hacked xinetd, exim is started as mail:mail now. The problem is
   	the directory and file permissions. Without those hacks, anyone
   	is capable of reading others mails.

   	- added an option to disable RFC1413 (identd) queries. This is 
   	a performance hack. Default timeout is 30 secs and noone is using
   	identd nowadays. Hacked CONFIGURE and BUILD.

   	- remarked xinetd logging options in xinetd.d/exim file, those adds a real
   	amount of wait time (20 secs on 100Mb, per connection) if the remote host 
  	can not be reverse mapped.

   	- added mysql as an optional depend, hacked BUILD script to satisfy that.
   	Now, if mysql is installed, it is possible to lookup mysql databases


2002-01-18  ?

    	The xinetd.d conf file for exim has been
    	updated to prevent exim act as an open relay.

2002-01-14  Kyle Sallee
