2003-02-18 Eric Schabell <eschabell@sourcemage.org>
	* There was no logging for exim, possible with /etc/exim.conf variable
	but this is strongly discouraged as you miss events that fail on startup:
	"It is generally advisable, however, to set the string in Local/Makefile 
	rather than at run time, because then the setting is available right from 
	the start of Exim's execution. Otherwise, if there's something it wants to 
	log before it has read the configuration file (for example, an error in 
	the configuration file) it will not use the path you want, and may not be 
	able to log at all."
	I have added it to the BUILD file for /var/log/exim_{panic|main|reject}.

2002-01-24 Kongar
	* DETAILS: exim 3.34, kongar
	* corrected a typo in POST_INSTALL which was a bug,
	disabling fcrons exim line
	* added EXIM_UID=`id -u mail` and EXIM_GID=`id -g mail` to the BUILD.  
	Also hacked xinetd, exim is started as mail:mail now. The problem is
	the directory and file permissions. Without those hacks, anyone
	is capable of reading others mails.
	* added an option to disable RFC1413 (identd) queries. This is 
	a performance hack. Default timeout is 30 secs and noone is using
	identd nowadays. Hacked CONFIGURE and BUILD.
	* remarked xinetd logging options in xinetd.d/exim file, those adds a real
	amount of wait time (20 secs on 100Mb, per connection) if the remote host 
	can not be reverse mapped.
	* added mysql as an optional depend, hacked BUILD script to satisfy that.
	Now, if mysql is installed, it is possible to lookup mysql databases

2002-01-18 ?
	* The xinetd.d conf file for exim has been
	updated to prevent exim act as an open relay.

2002-01-14 Kyle Sallee
