		exim 3.34, kongar

	    	- corrected a typo in POST_INSTALL which was a bug,
	    	disabling fcrons exim line
	
	    	- added EXIM_UID=`id -u mail` and EXIM_GID=`id -g mail` to the BUILD.  
	   	Also hacked xinetd, exim is started as mail:mail now. The problem is
	   	the directory and file permissions. Without those hacks, anyone
	   	is capable of reading others mails.
	
	   	- added an option to disable RFC1413 (identd) queries. This is 
	   	a performance hack. Default timeout is 30 secs and noone is using
	   	identd nowadays. Hacked CONFIGURE and BUILD.
	
	   	- remarked xinetd logging options in xinetd.d/exim file, those adds a real
	   	amount of wait time (20 secs on 100Mb, per connection) if the remote host 
	  	can not be reverse mapped.
	
	   	- added mysql as an optional depend, hacked BUILD script to satisfy that.
	   	Now, if mysql is installed, it is possible to lookup mysql databases
	
	
2002-01-18  ?

	    	The xinetd.d conf file for exim has been
	    	updated to prevent exim act as an open relay.

2002-01-10  Kyle Sallee

	    	Added PAM support and CFLAGS optimization to exim spell

2002-01-14  Kyle Sallee

    		Fixed the spell so that it updates root's crontab and fcrontab properly.
