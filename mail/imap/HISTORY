	Make option NOSSL corrected to SSLTYPE, added patch to use ~/.imap/
	instead of ~, improved the structure of BUILD script by combining four
	separate 'make' into one parameterized. UPDATED changed because SSL was
	effectively not enabled.

	to 'cp -f' for binaries. No UPDATED change. Added CONFLICTS

	Separated IMAPd into a separate spell, imap. Fixed 'services' according to
	http://www.iana.org/assignments/port-numbers. 'services' and xinet.d/*
	changed to be non-executable. All services run under 'nobody'. Removed
	copying of manpages because they don't come with this archive. Removed
	copying of client binaries: only imapd, ipop2d and ipop3d are copied.
