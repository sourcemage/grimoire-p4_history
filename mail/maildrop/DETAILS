cat << EOF
maildrop is a replacement for your local mail delivery agent. maildrop
reads a mail message from standard input, then delivers the message to
your mailbox. maildrop knows how to deliver mail to mbox-style mailboxes,
and maildirs. "maildir" is a mailbox format used by the Qmail MTA.

maildrop is written in C++, and is significantly larger than procmail in
compiled form. However, it uses resources much more efficiently. Unlike
procmail, maildrop will not read a 10 megabyte mail message into
memory. Large messages are saved in a temporary file, and are filtered
from the temporary file. Temporary files are saved in the user's home
directory. If the standard input to maildrop is a file, and not a pipe,
a temporary file will not be necessary.
