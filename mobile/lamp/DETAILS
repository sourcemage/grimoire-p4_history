cat << EOF
LAMP (Linux And Managed Power) is a simple user-level tool to adapt
CPU frequency to CPU load, to achieve a balance between performance
and battery life for laptops.
LAMP simply follows CPU load. It regularly monitors CPU load
(every 1 second), and if this crosses a threshold (50%), 
it steps up to the processor's maximum frequency. 
If the load falls below the threshold, it steps down to a lower frequency.
