Card Services for Linux is a complete PCMCIA or PC Card support
package. It includes a set of loadable kernel modules that implement
a version of the Card Services applications program interface, a set
of client drivers for specific cards, and a card manager daemon that
can respond to card insertion and removal events, loading and
unloading drivers on demand. It supports hot swapping of most card
types, so cards can be safely inserted and ejected at any time.
