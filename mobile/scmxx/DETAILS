SCMxx is a console program that allows you to exchange certain types of data with mobile phones made by Siemens. Some of the data types that can be exchanged are logos, ring tones, vCalendars, vCards, phonebook entries, and SMS messages. It works with the following phones: S25, C35i, M35i, S35i, ME45, S45, SL45, M50, and probably some others, too. It basically uses the AT command set published by Siemens (with some other additional resources).
