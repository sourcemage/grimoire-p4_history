I don't know if it works or not I can't get it to compile


It is broken on 2.6.10. Also, there have been no updates since 20041223, and I've got errors whenever I tried to post on prism54 foruns. Jose Bernardo

A small point - the cvs/svn version should force the download when you cast, or use the formula I had to calculate the date. Jose Bernardo
