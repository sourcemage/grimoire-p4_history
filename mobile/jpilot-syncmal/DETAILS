cat << EOF

SyncMAL is an interface to the command-line tool malsync, a program that
synchronizes a PDA with a MAL server such as AvantGo.  See AvantGo's homepage
(http://www.avantgo.com/) for more information on AvantGo and MAL.

IMPORTANT: GTK2 support was added as an experimental option to J-Pilot 0.99.4.
If you have enabled GTK2 support in J-Pilot, then you must also enable GTK2
support in jpilot-syncmal.  The converse is also true: if you did not enable
GTK2 support in J-Pilot, then you must not enable it for jpilot-syncmal.  You
can tell whether J-Pilot has GTK2 support enabled by clicking Help then
J-Pilot.
