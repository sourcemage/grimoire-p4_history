cat << EOF
Converts plain text files to/from the Doc format used by PalmPilots; also 
utilities to convert HTML files to Doc and vice versa; There was only one 
other such utility, unixdoc, out there and the code was pretty crufty and 
not documented, so I cleaned it up, rewrote chunks of it, and documented it.
