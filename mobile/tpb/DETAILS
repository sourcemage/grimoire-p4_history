cat << EOF
With TPB it is possible to bind a program to the ThinkPad, Mail, Home and Search button. 
TPB can also run a callback program on each state change with the changed state 
and the new state as options. So it is possible to trigger several actions on different events. 
TPB has a on-screen display (OSD) to show volume, mute, brightness and some other informations. 
Furthermore TPB supports a software mixer, as the R series ThinkPads have no 
hardware mixer to change the volume.
