jpilot-Mail is a plugin for jpilot which enables you to deliver mail that was written 
on your pilot and upload mail that you received to your pilot. 

jpilot-Mail sends mails via SMTP. This code was directly recycled from my other GNU 
software project, masqmail. 

jpilot-Mail is already usable but it is still in development stage: anything may happen! 
If you loose Mail or mail is scrambled or whatever do not blame me. You have been warned.
