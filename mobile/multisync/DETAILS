MultiSync is a free modular program to synchronize calendars, addressbooks and
other PIM data between programs on your computer and other computers, mobile
devices, PDAs or cell phones. MultiSync works on any Gnome platform, such as
Linux.

  Multisync also support Evolution 2;

  T68i/T610/Z600, Siemens S55 phones etc.) via Bluetooth or IR on Linux, or
  cable connection;

  project;
* Opie and Zaurus synchronization;
* SyncML support (supported by e.g. SonyEricsson P800/P900 and many other
