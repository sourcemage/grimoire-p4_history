cat << EOF
OpenSync is a synchronization framework that is platform and distribution independent.
 It consists of several plugins that can be used to connect to devices, a powerfull 
sync-engine and the framework itself.
 The synchronization framework is kept very flexible and is capable of synchronizing any 
type of data, including contacts, calendar, tasks, notes and files.
