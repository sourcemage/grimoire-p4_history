cat << EOF
As the name suggests, this little program lets you
change your Gtk+ 2.0 theme. The aim is to make theme
preview and selection as slick as possible. Themes
installed on the system are presented for selection
and previewed on the fly. For a comprehensive
demonstration there's a large variety of widgets.
