DESCRIPTION:
This program is designed to rain fire and brimstone upon a thousand lands
crushing an infinite number of souls with devestation never before experienced
by man.  Either that, or it might just be a simple
Mixer Utility for Linux systems.  Requires /dev/mixer to work.  The
3 buttons are quite simply Volume, CD, and PCM.

And of course, asmixer looks best under the Afterstep WM!

[To run in Windowmaker:  asmixer -w ]
