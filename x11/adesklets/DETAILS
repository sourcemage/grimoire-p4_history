adesklets is an interactive Imlib2  console for the X Window system. 
It provides scripted languages with a clean and simple way to write great 
looking, mildly interactive desktop integrated graphic applets 
(aka desklets).
It can also be used as a command line oriented graphic editor, a bit 
similar to ImageMagick , but with different functionality.
