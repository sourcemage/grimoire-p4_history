        Modified CONFIGURE and POST_INSTALL to copy and recover existing 
        xdm and xinit configs as "#define InstallXdmConfig  NO" and 
        "#define InstallXinitConfig  NO" were not effective at 
        preventing these files from being reaped.

        Added zlib security patch: 4.2.0-zlib-security.patch

20020120	Kyle Sallee

        Modified spell to support version 4.2.0 & Linux-PAM

20020102	Kyle Sallee

        Modified CONFIGURE to give SAs a more precise configuration.

20020109	Kyle Sallee

        Modified BUILD so that "#define BuildXF86DRM  NO" is added
        to config/cf/host.def is "CONFIG_DRM=y" is in
        /usr/src/linux/.config.  In simple terms an SA can compile 
        DRM in xfree86 or the linux kernel, but not both, otherwise
        xfree86 fails to compile & install.  Jon Svendsen figured 
        out the conflict, I added the fix.  Great teamwork, Jon!

        I was incorrect about my assumptiosn on 20020109.  The
        problem turned out to be mistake in a 
        xc/programs/Xserver/hw/xfree86/os-support/linux/drm/kernel/drm.h
        within the xfree86 source.  I included a patch.
