2002-01-02  Kyle Sallee

		Modified CONFIGURE to give SAs a more precise configuration.

2002-01-09  Kyle Sallee

		Modified BUILD so that "#define BuildXF86DRM  NO" is added to
		config/cf/host.def is "CONFIG_DRM=y" is in
		/usr/src/linux/.config.  In simple terms an SA can compile DRM
		in xfree86 or the linux kernel, but not both, otherwise xfree86
		fails to compile & install.  Jon Svendsen figured out the
		conflict, I added the fix.  Great teamwork, Jon!

2002-01-10  Kyle Sallee

		I was incorrect about my assumptions on 20020109.  
		The problem turned out to be mistake in a
		xc/programs/Xserver/hw/xfree86/os-support/linux/drm/kernel/drm.h
		within the xfree86 source.  I included a patch.
