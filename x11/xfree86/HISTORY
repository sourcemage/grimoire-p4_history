        Modified CONFIGURE and POST_INSTALL to copy and recover existing 
	xdm and xinit configs as "#define InstallXdmConfig  NO" and 
	"#define InstallXinitConfig  NO" were not effective at 
	preventing these files from being reaped.

        Added zlib security patch: 4.2.0-zlib-security.patch

20020120	Kyle Sallee
	Modified spell to support version 4.2.0 & Linux-PAM

20020102	Kyle Sallee
	Modified CONFIGURE to give SAs a more precise configuration.

20020109	Kyle Sallee
	Modified BUILD so that "#define BuildXF86DRM  NO" is added
	to config/cf/host.def is "CONFIG_DRM=y" is in
	/usr/src/linux/.config.  In simple terms an SA can compile 
	DRM in xfree86 or the linux kernel, but not both, otherwise
	xfree86 fails to compile & install.  Jon Svendsen figured 
	out the conflict, I added the fix.  Great teamwork, Jon!

	I was incorrect about my assumptiosn on 20020109.  The
	problem turned out to be mistake in a 
	xc/programs/Xserver/hw/xfree86/os-support/linux/drm/kernel/drm.h
	within the xfree86 source.  I included a patch.
