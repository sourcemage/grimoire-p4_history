cat << EOF
Xrmap is a program running under X that can interactively display portions of
the Earth, using the huge CIA world vector map. It is based on an earlier
console utility 'rmap'. It features political boundaries, major and minor
rivers, glaciers, lakes, canals, etc. The map remains accurate under a very
large zoom factor, which can possibly exceed 100. Spherical, rectangular,
Mercator and Miller projections are implemented, and all features can be
interactively set from the GUI.

As described in freshmeat entry.
