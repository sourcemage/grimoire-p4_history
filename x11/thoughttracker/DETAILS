ThoughtTracker is a knowledge base application of sorts.
Its purpose is to provide you with an efficiently
interfaced database where to store those infrequent ideas
that are worth keeping or facts learnt by experience you
don't want to forget but don't know anywhere else to put. 

Unlike other programs of its kind, ThoughtTracker doesn't
force you to put your facts'n'thoughts in some hierarchy
or even store them without any mutual connections
whatsoever. Much rather, it allows you to make entries and
connect them to any number of others via bidirectional
links. A simple but efficient search function allows you to
find records, and once you've found the one you were
looking for, its links will refer you to related notes.
