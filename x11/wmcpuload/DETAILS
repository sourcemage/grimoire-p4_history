cat << EOF
WMCPULoad is a program to monitor CPU usage. It is a dockapp that is supported by X window managers such as Window Maker, AfterStep, BlackBox, and Enlightenment.

It displays the current usage, expressed as a percentile and a chart, and has an LCD look-alike user interface. The back-light may be turned on/off by clicking the mouse button over the application. If the CPU usage hits a certain threshold, an alarm-mode will alert you by turning back-light on.

It runs under GNU/Linux / FreeBSD / OpenBSD / Solaris / Cygwin
