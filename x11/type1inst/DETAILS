           SHORT="a utility to create fonts.scale and fonts.dir files for Type1 fonts"
cat << EOF
While it is possible to create the 'fonts.scale' file by hand, it is simpler and more convenient to have it generated automatically. Utilities to perform this task are available, but are not currently included with XFree86. For Type 1 fonts, you may use a utility called 'type1inst' which is available from standard Free Software repositories throughout the world.
