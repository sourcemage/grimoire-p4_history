VICE is a Versatile Commodore Emulator, i.e. a program that runs on a
Unix, MS-DOS/Win95/NT or RiscOS machine and executes programs intended
for the old 8-bit Commodore computers. The current version emulates the
C64, the C128 (80 column screen is included now), the VIC20, all the PET
models (except the SuperPET 9000, which is out of line anyway) and the
CBM-II (aka C610).
