Based on 'xearth', xmars generates an image of Mars, 
showing the true position of the terminator at the 
current time, and has markers for the various U.S
landers, Prime Meridian, Olymus Mons, and the 'Face 
on Mars'. Help would be appreciated in obtaining better 
orbital parameters. One or two were determined 
empirically during the 'Pathfinder' mission. Also, the 
program shows the planet as a plain sphere; some way of 
mapping a ground-texture map onto it would be nice. All 
help and bugfixes are gratefully received.
