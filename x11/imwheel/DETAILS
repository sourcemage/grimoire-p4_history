cat << EOF
This is a not so short little ditty that does the simple conversion of mouse
button presses into key presses.  By grabbing only the 4th and 5th mouse buttons
the program is able to receive input from the Intellimouse series mice.  There
is also a modified version of gpm included that has, already, support for the
Intellimouse, and I added a wheel fifo.  The user library may also be used,
although this may need to be debugged.  See the gpm section below for more.
The wheel button can always be used as middle button, this program does not
affect how the XServer, nor GPM, react towards it.  A mouse with a wheel button
is a 3 button mouse, and should be configured as such!
