cat << EOF
Imwheel makes the wheel of your Intellimouse (and other wheel and
stick mice) work in Linux/X11 to scroll windows up and down, or send
keys to programs. It runs in the background as a daemon and requires
little reconfiguration of the XWindows setup. 4 or more button mice
and Alps Glidepad 'Taps' may also be used. imwheel includes a
modified gpm for an alternate method of wheel input.
