 3D-Desktop FX is an add-on for 3D-Desktop that includes shortcuts to start and stop 3D-Desktop, adds in several new view settings (updated 3ddesktop.conf) and inludes a new script (3ddeskfx) that allows you to call all of the old and new views, including the ability to have a random mode or view each time you launch!
