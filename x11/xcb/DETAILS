Xcb provides easy access to the cut buffers built into every X server. It allows
the buffers to be manipulated either via the command line, or with the mouse in
a point and click manner. The buffers can be used as holding pens to store and
retrieve arbitrary data fragments. Any number of cut buffers may be created, so
any number of different pieces of data can be saved and recalled later. By
default, 8 cut buffers are created. The program is designed primarily for use
with textual data.
