xroottext.
Mike Shaver forwarded a program called xwrite to me.  It was just a
322-line C file that turned your X display's root window into a text
display.  I didn't like the way it worked, so I wrote a replacement
that worked the way I wanted.

  3 hours later, I had xroottext v0.7.  xroottext takes text from
stdin and renders it into a rectangular pseudo-terminal in the root
window.  It processes newlines and tabs (hard-coded to 8 characters)
and translates NULs to spaces, but all other characters are left
alone.  Text wraps to the next line when the "cursor" goes beyond the
last column.  The display scrolls when the "cursor" proceeds past the
last line.
