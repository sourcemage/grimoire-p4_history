WMAlbum is a dock applet that displays album covers for songs being played
by XMMS. You must already have images of the album covers stored near the
file being played. With WMAlbum you can control xmms using the circular
menu or use your mouse-wheel to control volume. By double-clicking WMAlbum
you can see the album cover image in full-size. Linger, and a tooltip will
appear with the artist and song title.
