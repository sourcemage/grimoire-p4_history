cat << EOF
MenuMaker is utility written entirely in Python that scans through the system
for installed programs and generates menu for specified X window manager. It is
by far more superior to existing solutions in terms of knowledge base size,
maintainability and extensibility, and has a number of features that have no
counterparts in its class. MenuMaker is intended for users of lightweight *NIX
graphical desktop environments.
