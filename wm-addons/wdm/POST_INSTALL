Please examine (and modify if necessary) the Xsession, Xclients, and
wdm-config files in the wdm config directory (by default: /uetc/wdm).  Also,
NOTE that the Xsession and Xclients (or ~./Xclients) files MUST be marked
executable.  These files are the shell files which actually create the user's
environment and start the window manager.  In addition, there can be a
~/.xsession or a ~/.Xclients file for each user in which case these files are
executed (and MUST be marked executable).
