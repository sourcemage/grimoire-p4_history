cat << EOF
WMBiff is an WindowMaker docking utility, that displays the number of read
and unread messages in up to five mailboxes.
You can also define actions to execute on new mail arrival (for example,
play a sound file), [auto]fetchmail from a remote server or to execute your
mail reader with a mouse click. WMBiff also supports notification of
incoming Licq messages, so you can put Licq in the background.

At this moment, wmbiff supports unix-style, maildir, pop3, APOP, IMAP
and IMAPS mailboxes, as well as Licq and GnomeICU history files.
