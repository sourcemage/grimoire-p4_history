ProFTPD is a proven, high-performance, scalable FTP server written
from scratch, with a focus toward simplicity, security, and ease of
configuration. Naturally, ProFTPD powers some of the largest sites on 
the Internet. It features a very Apache-like configuration syntax,
modules, and a highly customizable server infrastructure, including
support for multiple 'virtual' FTP servers, anonymous FTP, and
permission-based directory visibility.
