		Updated version to 3.1.3:
		* In this release, ls parsing is now more forgiving of weird /bin/ls
		  implementations. NcFTP is now more lenient on broken server
		  implementations which include extra blank lines in the control
		  connection conversation. This release also includes compatibility
		  fixes for IRIX 5.x, AIX 4.2.x, and Cygwin.
