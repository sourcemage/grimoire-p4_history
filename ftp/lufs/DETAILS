           SHORT='LUFS is a hybrid userspace filesystem framework'
cat << EOF
LUFS is a hybrid userspace filesystem framework supporting an indefinite
number of filesystems transparently for any application. It consists of
a kernel module and an userspace daemon. Basically it delegates most of
the VFS calls to a specialized daemon which handles them.

The reason for the userspace stuff: there are operations only suited for
userspace (cryptography for example) and implementing them in kernel
would be bloat.


The reason for the kernel stuff: I think it's important to keep the
filesystem access point at the lowest level in order to allow all the
applications to use it. Consider KDE: it implements its own virtual
filesystem, a great one, but only KDE applications can take advantage of
it. So does GNOME, MC and others. Suddenly we have lots of overlapping
userspace filesystem implementations, a real waste...
