FAGS (Free AudioGalaxy Satellite) is an open source
AudioGalaxy client for Linux and BSD (and possibly other
UNIXes). It supports downloading and uploading of files
(including resume), sharing of multiple directories,
sharing of MP3 and OGG files, protocol version 0.608W,
and asynchronous socket I/O.

If you don't know what AudioGalaxy is I suggest you take a
look at http://www.audiogalaxy.com/

This spell has an option to install system-wide, with an
init script and own user.
