cat << EOF
PureAdmin is a graphical tool used to make the management of PureFTPd a little easier.
It uses the GTK+2.x widgets for its GUI and thus are not dependent on a specific desktop environment such as GNOME or KDE. It is, however, designed with the GNOME Human Interface Guidelines in mind so it should integrate nicely with at least GNOME.
