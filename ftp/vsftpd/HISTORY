	* Fixes from Bearcat M. Sandor:
	  The VSFTP (very secure ftp daemon) had a few errors in the spell. The first was that the source location was outdated and would not retrieve. Also, the xinetd misrepresented the location of the executable as /usr/sbin, when it is really intalled in /usr/local/sbin
