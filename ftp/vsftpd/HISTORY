		Fixes from Bearcat M. Sandor:

		The VSFTP (very secure ftp daemon) had a few errors
		in the spell.  The first was that the source location
		was outdated and would not retrieve.  Also, the xinetd
		misrepresented the location of the executable as /usr/sbin,
		when it is really intalled in /usr/local/sbin
