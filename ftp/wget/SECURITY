Please note that due to the poorly written nature of wget, use of wget 
especially with -x and -r can be risky.

See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=261755

We have applied the control character patch and development versions of 
sorcery avoid the other vulnerabilities listed.

Hope is that shortly the upstream author of wget will release a new 
version to fix everything.
