   - corrected a typo in POST_INSTALL which was a bug,
   disabling fcrons exim line

   - added EXIM_UID=`id -u mail` and EXIM_GID=`id -g mail` to the BUILD.  
   Also hacked xinetd, exim is started as mail:mail now. The problem is
   the directory and file permissions. Without those hacks, anyone
   is capable of reading others mails.

   - added an option to disable RFC1413 (identd) queries. This is 
   a performance hack. Default timeout is 30 secs and noone is using
   identd nowadays. Hacked CONFIGURE and BUILD.

   - remarked xinetd logging options in xinetd.d/exim file, those adds a real
   amount of wait time (20 secs on 100Mb, per connection) if the remote host 
   can not be reverse mapped.

   - added mysql as an optional depend, hacked BUILD script to satisfy that.
   Now, if mysql is installed, it is possible to lookup mysql databases
