cat << EOF
Minimalist stands for Minimalistic Mailing Lists Manager. Although it is declared as minimalistic, it has many features as his eldest brosers, such as Majordomo and so on, but in contrast to them it is very small, fast, simple for setup and maintenance. Also it has very clean internal structure and if you are familiar with Perl, you can add as many additional features, as you need.

Supported features are:

    * configuration on per-list basis or globally;
    * support for global and/or list administrator;
    * support for authentication requests
    * support for read-only/closed/mandatory lists
    * additional services such as information about list, information about users of list and so on;
    * message archiving (internal or external archiver);
    * support for blacklist
    * logging

Minimalist doesn't support digests and author isn't even going to make this support available.
