Deliver
Deliver is a program for reliable and flexible local mail delivery. It's a
perfect adjunct to your mail transport of choice (Sendmail, Smail, exim,
qmail, etc.). I use it to:

 * kill spam
 * drop messages from people whose messages I don't care to read
 * add a [LISTNAME] prefix to the subjects of messages that are
delivered through mailing lists
 * drop redundant copies of messages I've already received
