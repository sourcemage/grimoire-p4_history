Tired of all those unsightly printable characters in your perl source? Worry no more with Acme::Bleach, the only perl module guaranteed to have your sources sparkling whitespace in no time at all!

Acme::DWIM replaces all those boring operators with the "Do What I Mean" operator (...) pronounced "yadda yadda yadda".

Includes Acme::Bleach, Acme::DWIM and Acme::Morse.

Damian Conway has a lot to answer for.
