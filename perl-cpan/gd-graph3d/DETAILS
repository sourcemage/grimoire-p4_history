cat << EOF
This is the GD::Graph3d extensions module. It provides 3D graphs for the
GD::Graph module by Martien Verbruggen, which in turn generates graph using
Lincoln Stein's GD.pm.

You use these modules just as you would any of the GD::Graph modules, except
that they generate 3d-looking graphs. Each graph type is described below with
only the options that are unique to the 3d version. The modules are based on
their 2d versions (e.g. GD::Graph::bars3d works like GD::Graph::bars), and
support all the options in those. Make sure to read the documentation on
GD::Graph.
