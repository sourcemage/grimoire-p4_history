cat << EOF
The Devel::DProf package is a Perl code profiler.  This
will collect information on the execution time of a Perl
script and of the subs in that script.  This information
can be used to determine which subroutines are using the
most time and which subroutines are being called most
often.  This information can also be used to create an
execution graph of the script, showing subroutine rela­
tionships.
