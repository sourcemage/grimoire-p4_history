cat << EOF
This package consists of a C library and a Perl module
(which uses the C library, internally) for all kinds of
date calculations based on the Gregorian calendar (the one
used in all western countries today), thereby complying
with all relevant norms and standards: ISO/R 2015-1971,
DIN 1355 and, to some extent, ISO 8601 (where applicable).
