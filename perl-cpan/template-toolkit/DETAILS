The Template Toolkit is a fast, powerful and easily extensible template
processing system written in Perl  with certain key elements coded in C for
maximum speed. It is ideally suited (but not limited) to the creation of static
and dynamic web content, and incorporates various modules and tools to simplify
this process. The Toolkit is highly portable, with minimal dependencies or
restrictions on how and where it can be used. It is robust, reliable, well
documented and freely available as Open Source.
