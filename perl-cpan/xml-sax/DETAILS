           SHORT="Perl SAX2 XML Parser Framework"
cat << EOF
XML::SAX consists of several framework classes for using and building Perl SAX2
XML parsers, filters, and drivers. It is designed around the need to be able to
"plug in" different SAX parsers to an application without requiring programmer
intervention. Those of you familiar with the DBI will be right at home. Some of
the designs come from the Java JAXP specification (SAX part), only without the
javaness.
