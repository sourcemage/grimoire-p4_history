cat << EOF
This Perl module implements Perl hashes that preserve the
order in which the hash elements were added.  The order is
not affected when values corresponding to existing keys in
the IxHash are changed.  The elements can also be set to
any arbitrary supplied order.  The familiar perl array
operations can also be performed on the IxHash.
