The fundamental task of the "autoformat" subroutine is to
identify and rearrange independent paragraphs in a text.
Paragraphs typically consist of a series of lines contain­
ing at least one non-whitespace character, followed by one
or more lines containing only optional whitespace.  This
is a more liberal definition than many other formatters
use: most require an empty line to terminate a paragraph.
Paragraphs may also be denoted by bulleting, numbering, or
quoting (see the following sections).
