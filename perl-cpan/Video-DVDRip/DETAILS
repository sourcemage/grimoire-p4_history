dvd::rip is a full featured DVD copy program written in Perl. 
It provides an easy to use but feature-rich Gtk+ GUI to control 
almost all aspects of the ripping and transcoding process. It uses 
the widely known video processing swissknife transcode and many 
other Open Source tools.

dvd::rip itself is licensed under GPL / Perl Artistic License.
