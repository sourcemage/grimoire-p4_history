This module provides a basic framework for creating and maintaining RDF
Site Summary (RSS) files. This distribution also contains many examples
that allow you to generate HTML from an RSS, convert between 0.9, 0.91,
and 1.0 version, and other nifty things.  This might be helpful if you
want to include news feeds on your Web site from sources like Slashot
and Freshmeat or if you want to syndicate your own content.
