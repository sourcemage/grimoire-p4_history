cat << EOF
The pkg-config program retrieves information about installed libraries,
usually for the purposes of compiling against and linking to them.

ExtUtils::PkgConfig is a very simplistic interface to this utility, intended
for use in the Makefile.PL of perl extensions which bind libraries that
pkg-config knows.  It is really just boilerplate code that you would've
written yourself.
