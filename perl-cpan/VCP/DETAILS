cat << EOF
vcp (and the Perl module VCP.pm) is a system for copying resources under version
control between repositories. cvs, p4 and RevML files are currently supported.
VCP can re-root directory hierarchies diring the transfer, and, using source
specifications, or by filtering RevML files, subsets of files and revisions may
be copied.
Both whole-repository and incremental updates are supported.
