cat << EOF
diff() provides a basic set of services akin to the GNU diff utility. It is not
anywhere near as feature complete as GNU diff, but it is better integrated with
Perl and available on all platforms. It is often faster than shelling out to a
system's diff executable for small files, and generally slower on larger files.

Relies on Algorithm::Diff for, well, the algorithm. This may not produce the
same exact diff as a system's local diff executable, but it will be a valid
diff and comprehensible by patch. We haven't seen any differences between
Algorithm::Diff's logic and GNU diff's, but we have not examined them to make
sure they are indeed identical.
