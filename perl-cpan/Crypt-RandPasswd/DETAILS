This code is a Perl language implementation of the Auto­
mated Password Generator standard, like the program
described in "A Random Word Generator For Pronounceable
Passwords" (not available on-line).  This code is a re-
engineering of the program contained in Appendix A of FIPS
Publication 181, "Standard for Automated Password Genera­
tor".  In accordance with the standard, the results
obtained from this program are logically equivalent to
those produced by the standard.
