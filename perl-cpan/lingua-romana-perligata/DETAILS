The Lingua::Romana::Perligata makes it makes it possible to write Perl
programs in Latin. (If you have to ask "Why?", then the answer probably
won't make any sense to you either.)

The module is used at the start of the program, and installs a filter
which allows the rest of the program to be written in (modified) Latin,
as described in the accompanying documentation.
