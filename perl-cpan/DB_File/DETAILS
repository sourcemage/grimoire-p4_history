DB_File is a module which allows Perl programs to make use of the facilities
provided by Berkeley DB version 1.x (if you have a newer version of DB, see
Using DB_File with Berkeley DB version 2 or greater). It is assumed that you
have a copy of the Berkeley DB manual pages at hand when reading this
documentation. The interface defined here mirrors the Berkeley DB interface
closely.

Berkeley DB is a C library which provides a consistent interface to a number
of database formats. DB_File provides an interface to all three of the
database types currently supported by Berkeley DB.
