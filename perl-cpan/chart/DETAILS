This module is an attempt to build a general purpose graphing module that is
easily modified and expanded. I borrowed most of the API from Martien
Verbruggen's GIFgraph module. I liked most of GIFgraph, but I thought it was
to difficult to modify, and it was missing a few things that I needed, most
notably legends. So I decided to write a new module from scratch, and I've
designed it from the bottom up to be easy to modify. Like GIFgraph, Chart
uses Lincoln Stein's GD module for all of its graphics primitives calls.
