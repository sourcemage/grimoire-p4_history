           SHORT="Algorithm::Diff - Compute intelligent differences between two files or lists"
cat << EOF
This is a module for computing the difference between two files, two strings, or
any other two lists of things.  It uses an  intelligent algorithm similar to (or
identical to) the one used by the Unix diff program.   It is guaranteed to find
the *smallest possible* set of differences.
