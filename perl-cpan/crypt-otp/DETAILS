           SHORT="Implements One Time Pad encryption"
cat << EOF
The One Time Pad encryption method is very simple, and
impossible to crack without the actual pad file against
which the to-be-encrypted message is XOR'ed.  Encryption
and decryption are performed using excactly the same
method, and the message will decrypt correctly only if the
same pad is used in decryption as was use in encryption.
