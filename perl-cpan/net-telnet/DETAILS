cat << EOF
Net::Telnet allows you to make client connections to a TCP
port and do network I/O, especially to a port using the
TELNET protocol.  Simple I/O methods such as print, get,
and getline are provided.  More sophisticated interactive
features are provided because connecting to a TELNET port
ultimately means communicating with a program designed for
human interaction.  These interactive features include the
ability to specify a time-out and to wait for patterns to
appear in the input stream, such as the prompt from a
shell.
