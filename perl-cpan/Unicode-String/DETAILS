cat << EOF

A Unicode::String object represents a sequence of Unicode
characters.  The Unicode Standard is a fixed-width, uni­
form encoding scheme for written characters and text.
This encoding treats alphabetic characters, ideographic
characters, and symbols identically, which means that they
can be used in any mixture and with equal facility.  Uni­
code is modeled on the ASCII character set, but uses a
16-bit encoding to support full multilingual text.
