Term::ReadKey is a compiled perl module dedicated to pro­
viding simple control over terminal driver modes (cbreak,
raw, cooked, etc.,) support for non-blocking reads, if the
architecture allows, and some generalized handy functions
for working with terminals. One of the main goals is to
have the functions as portable as possible, so you can
just plug in "use Term::ReadKey" on any architecture and
have a good likelyhood of it working.
