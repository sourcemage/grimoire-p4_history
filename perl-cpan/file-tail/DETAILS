cat << EOF
The File::Tail module is designed for reading files which are continously
appended to (the name comes from the tail -f directive). Usualy such files are
logfiles of some description.

The module tries hard not to busy wait on the file, dynamicaly calcultaing 
how long it should wait before it pays to try reading the file again.
