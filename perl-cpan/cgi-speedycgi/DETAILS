cat << EOF
SpeedyCGI is a way to run perl scripts persistently, which can make them run much
more quickly. A script can be made to to run persistently by changing the
interpreter line at the top of the script from:
    #!/usr/bin/perl
to
    #!/usr/bin/speedy
After the script is initially run, instead of exiting, the perl interpreter is
kept running. During subsequent runs, this interpreter is used to handle new
executions instead of starting a new perl interpreter each time. A very fast
frontend program, written in C, is executed for each request. This fast frontend
then contacts the persistent Perl process, which is usually already running, to 
do the work and return the results.
