PVA.pl is not part of the original tarball, it's probably supposed to be
generated or reused from earlier installation of Perl. It is present at
/usr/lib/perl5/5.8.6/unicore/PVA.pl from Perl 5.8.6, but the compile fails
whether Perl 5.8.6 is present or dispelled.

Has any one else tried perl 5.8.7? It builds for me with the spell from 
devel. - George Sherwood "p3pilot"



also build ok for me - Treeve Jelbert
only problem that I encountered was the UP_TRIGGERS, which caused things to be ressurrected 
rather than recast
