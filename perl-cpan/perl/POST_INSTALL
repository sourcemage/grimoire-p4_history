	I see you've got a 5.6.1 perl library. This probably
	means that you're upgrading perl.

	If this is not the case you can skip the next paragraph
	and just answer no to the question...

	   Perl 5.8 is binary incompatible with previous versions
	   this means that you'll have to rebuild all installed 
	   perl spell's. I can do that for you.

	   After all spells have successfully been build you'll have to
	   remember to _MANUALLY_ remove the following directories:
	   
	      rm -rf /usr/lib/perl5/5.6.1
	      rm -rf /usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.6.1

    if  query  "Do you want me to rebuild all perl spells?"  n
    then
	for  spell  in  $(gaze  section  perl-cpan)
	do
	    if [ $spell != perl ]
	    then 
		gaze  installed  $spell  &&  cast  $spell
	    fi
	done

	cat  <<- ________EOM

	if all spells have successfully been build, you can now
	remove the 5.6.1 libraries, unless you've been installing
	perl modules without using spells. It is a good idea to update
	those too and remove the 5.6.1 libs.
