Perl is a high-level, general-purpose programming language that makes
easy things easy and hard things possible. It is optimized for scanning
arbitrary text files and system administration. It has built-in extended
regular expression matching and replacement, a dataflow mechanism to
improve security with setuid scripts and is extendable via modules that
can interface to C libraries.
