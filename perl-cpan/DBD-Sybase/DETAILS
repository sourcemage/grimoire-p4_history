cat << EOF
I now have a reasonably complete implementation of the DBI API for 
Sybase in the DBD::Sybase module. It isn't 100% compliant yet.  
It is an alpha release, so test thoroughly before using, and be
forwarned that certain aspects of the Sybase specific section of the
API (Sybase specific attributes, for example) could change in future 
versions (although it's unlikely). For more info on DBI try
http://dbi.perl.org. Please help make this module better - report any
problems you get so that I can try to fix the problems 
(it's even better if you add include a patch that fixes the problem!) 

Note: you can check for patches and experimental versions at 
http://www.peppler.org/downloads
