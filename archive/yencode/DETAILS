yencode is an encoder/decoder package for the Usenet yEnc encoding format.

The source code is freely available under the GNU General Public License 
and should work on most modern Unix-like operating systems.

Features:

    * Encoder can output single part or multipart encoded archives of any size.
    * Smart decoder can handle multiple files, including files specified 
      out of order or with nonsense file names.
    * Included Usenet posting software posts files to Usenet quickly and 
      easily, including automatic retries and resumption of aborted postings, 
      plus automatic creation of encoded multipart archives and SFV/CRC 
      checksum files, if desired.
    * Optional scan mode: automatically locate and decode single or multipart 
      encoded archives in specified directories or recursively.
    * Supports SFV file creation for multiple-file archives.
    * Fully compliant with the current yEnc specifications. 

Note: yEnc is considered harmfull to usenet.
