cat << EOF
yydecode is a highly portable decoder for yEnc encoded binaries, which unfortunately has 
recently been spreading like wildfire on Usenet. The name ?yydecode? is a play on the 
infamous ?uudecode? program, although that?s not the only similarity ? yydecode aims to 
behave like uudecode; in normal circumstances it can be used as a direct drop-in 
replacement.

Note: yEnc is considered harmfull to usenet.
