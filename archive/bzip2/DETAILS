cat << EOF
bzip2 is a freely available, patent free (see below), high-quality data
compressor. It typically compresses files to within 10% to 15% of the
best available techniques (the PPM family of statistical compressors),
whilst being around twice as fast at compression and six times faster at
decompression.
