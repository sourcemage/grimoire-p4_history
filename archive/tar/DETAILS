GNU tar - Creates tar archives
Can create tar archives, as well as other forms of manipulation. For
example, you can use tar on previously created archives to extract
files, store additional files, or update or list files which were
already stored.
Tar can direct its output to available devices, files, or other programs
(using pipes); tar can even access remote devices or files (as
archives).
The program saves many files together into a single tape or disk
archive, and can restore individual files from the archive. It includes
multivolume support, the ability to archive sparse files, automatic
archive compression/decompression, remote archives and special features
that allow 'tar' to be used for incremental and full backups.
