	* DETAILS: upgrade to 4.16;
	* PRE_BUILD: adjust x86 and add x86_64 architecture; PowerPC may also work.

	* PRE_BUILD: mark the place where architecture would be sensed;
	* ALL: apparently a spell for the same software was made by
	  David Kowis and corrected by David himself and Neuron. This
	  spell doesn't use that code, PRE_BUILD, BUILD and INSTALL
	  are all different. Apparently this was waste of energy on
	  my part because of an oversight, but I believe there's no
	  reason to change a working spell now.

	* ALL: spell created.
