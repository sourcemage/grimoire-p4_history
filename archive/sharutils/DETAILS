GNU shar makes so-called shell archives out of many files, preparing
them for transmission by electronic mail services.  A shell archive is a
collection of files that can be unpacked by /bin/sh.  A wide range of
features provide extensive flexibility in manufacturing shars and in
specifying shar smartness. For example, shar may compress files,
uuencode binary files, split long files and construct multi-part
mailings, ensure correct unsharing order, and provide simplistic checksums. 

GNU unshar scans a set of mail messages looking for the start of shell
archives. It will automatically strip off the mail headers and
other introductory text. The archive bodies are then unpacked by a copy
of the shell. unshar may also process files containing concatenated
shell archives.
