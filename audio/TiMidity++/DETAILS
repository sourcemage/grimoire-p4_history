TiMidity is a MIDI to WAVE converter and player that uses Gravis Ultrasound(*)-compatible patch files to generate digital audio data from
general MIDI files. The audio data can be played through any sound device or stored on disk. On a fast machine, music can be played in real
time. TiMidity runs under Linux, FreeBSD, HP-UX, SunOS, and Win32, and porting to other systems with gcc should be easy.
