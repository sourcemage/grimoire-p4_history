prokyon3 is a multithreaded MP3/ogg manager and tag editor for Linux. It was
written in C++ using the Qt3 widget set and the MySQL database. prokyon3
can access MP3/ogg files on harddisk, CDROM, SMB and NFS. Files can be
played using XMMS, and can even be played when the files are on CD as
prokyon3 identifies CDs by content. The files view is customizable and
favorite artists are supported. prokyon3 also offers an editor for ID3
tags and has been designed to support tagging for multiple files en
masse.

Note the this program requires mysql support to be compiled into Qt. If you
have problems with prokyon3 not being able to connect to mysql, you probably
need to cast -r -c qt-x11 and enable mysql support.
