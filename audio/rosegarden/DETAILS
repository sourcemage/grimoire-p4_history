Rosegarden-4 is the new development series of the Rosegarden MIDI and audio sequencer and musical notation editor. It is free software for Unix and X.
It's a KDE application, which means it needs the KDE libraries, but it can be run within the KDE environment or any other desktop or window manager
environment.
