           SHORT="Beep the pc speaker in any number of ways."
cat << EOF
Beep allows the user to control the pc-speaker with precision,
allowing different sounds to indicate different events. While it
can be run quite happily on the commandline, it's intended place
of residence is within shell/perl scripts, notifying the user when
something interesting occurs. Of course, it has no notion of
what's interesting, but it's real good at the notifying part.
