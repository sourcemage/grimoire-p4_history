cat << EOF
GNOMAD is a GTK+ client program for the NOMAD Jukebox, using libnjb and id3lib to handle the jukebox communications and ID3 tagging procedures.

Naturally it suffers from the uncompleteness of these libraries which are currently both in beta (2002-01-07) so don't expect too much. The ID3 stuff seems to work flawlessly though.
