cat << EOF 
The Zinf audio player is a simple, but powerful audio player for Linux 
and Win32. It supports MP3, Ogg/Vorbis, WAV and Audio CD playback, with 
a powerful music browser, theme support and a download manager.

It is based on the FreeA*p audio player which was developed by EMusic.
The FreeA*p project was discontinued due to a trademark conflict and
EMusic being acquired by Vivendi.
