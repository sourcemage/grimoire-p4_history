SoundTracker is a music tracking tool for Unix / X11 similar in design
to the DOS program FastTracker and the Amiga legend ProTracker. Samples
can be lined up on tracks and patterns which are then arranged to a
song. Supported module formats are XM and MOD; the player code is the
one from OpenCP. A basic sample recorder and editor is also included.
