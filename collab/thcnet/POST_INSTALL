Please map an URI on your Web server to /usr/share/$SPELL
to enable THCNET. Also make sure PHP is enabled.

If you want to customize it, modify the *.template *.css files to make things
look how you want, and modify the any and all source code as you see fit.

In order to complete the installation of THCNET, you must open
http://localhost/<URI>/thcnet.php in your browser.  It will prompt you
for values it needs to complete the installation.  Click on setup and
it will create the
database for you and populate it.

After that, the next task will be to apply as a new user.  The first user to
apply will be given sys-admin rights.

Then you can customize features by clicking on the Admin link to the left.
