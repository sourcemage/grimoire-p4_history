	Updated for 2.1RC3, removed patching of configuration for LDAP but left
	patching slapd.conf. Now comes with only one schema file, so extra info
	has been removed from gawk script.

	Spell created. Preferred method of authentication and preference
	serialization is using LDAP, hence slapd.conf gets updated when
	necessary. Depends on the latest php as described in DETAILS,
	in particular on --with-imap and --with-ldap.
