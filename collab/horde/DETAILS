           SHORT="Horde Application Framework is a general-purpose web application framework in PHP"
cat << EOF
The Horde Framework is the glue that all Horde applications have in common.
It is many things, including some coding standards, common code, and
inter-application communication. The shared code provides common ways of
handling things like preferences, permissions, browser detection, user help,
and more.

Required PHP compilation options (BUILD fails if they were off):
	--with-gettext	for internationalization support
	--with-xml		for XML support
	--with-imap		for IMAP and POP3 support
Recommended PHP compilation options:
	--with-mysql	to store preferences in MySQL (tested thoroughly)
	--with-pgsql	to store preferences in PostgreSQL (teste thoroughly)
	--with-oracle	to store preferences in Oracle (known to work)
	--with-ldap		to store preferences in LDAP
	--with-mcrypt	to provide cryptographics beyond PHP built-in
	--enable-ftp	for Gollem support
Also recommended:
	sendmail(8) API and a local sendmail interface (included with sendmail,
	postfix, qmail, exim, and others) as specified by dependency on
	mail-transport-agent in DEPENDS
