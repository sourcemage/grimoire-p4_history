cat << EOF
The Horde Framework is the glue that all Horde applications have in common.
It is many things, including some coding standards, common code, and
inter-application communication. The shared code provides common ways of
handling things like preferences, permissions, browser detection, user help,
and more.

--with-gettext for internationalization support
--with-xml     for XML support

Recommended PHP compilation options:
--with-mysql  to store preferences in MySQL
--with-pgsql  to store preferences in PostgreSQL
--with-oracle to store preferences in Oracle
--with-ldap   to store preferences in LDAP
--with-mcrypt to provide cryptographics beyond PHP built-in
--enable-ftp  for Gollem support
