cat << EOF
The goal of this project is to write a high-quality GUI client for Subversion.
This client is written entirely in Python, using bindings to GTK and the
Subversion libraries. At a minimum, this client should work on all Unix-like
systems with X windows. It should also be possible to run on Win32, given
that Python, Subversion, and GTK are all known to work there.
