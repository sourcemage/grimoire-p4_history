cat << EOF
Mailman is software to help manage email discussion lists,
much like Majordomo and Smartmail. Unlike most similar
products, Mailman gives each mailing list a web page, and
allows users to subscribe, unsubscribe, etc. over the web.
Even the list manager can administer his or her list
entirely from the web. Mailman also integrates most things
people want to do with mailing lists, including archiving,
mail to news gateways, and so on.
