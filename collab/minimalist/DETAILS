Minimalist stands for Minimalistic Mailing Lists Manager. Although it is
declared as minimalistic, it has many features as his eldest brosers, such as
Majordomo and so on, but in contrast to them it is very small, fast, simple for
setup and maintenance. Also it has very clean internal structure and if you are
familiar with Perl, you can add as many additional features, as you need.

Supported features are:
*	configuration on per-list basis or globally;
*	support for global and/or list administrator;
*	support for authentication requests
*	support for read-only/closed/mandatory lists
*	additional services such as information about list, information about users
	of list and so on;
*	message archiving (internal or external archiver);
*	support for blacklist
*	logging

Minimalist doesn't support digests and author isn't even going to make this
support available.
