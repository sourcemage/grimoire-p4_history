	Added customizations and patch to provide automatic install of the spell
	with more secure parameters, including random password and port, and ssl
	enabled. Also automated is UNIX flavor selection, locations of logs and
	pid file, etc.

2002-05-08 Sergey Lipnevich <sergeyli@pisem.net>

	Added to my section collab and updated version to 0.970, mainly due
	to a secutiry flaw found in version 0.960. Applied minor formatting
	changes to scripts.

	Spell created by Filip Sergeys <filip.sergeys@xarus.com>.
