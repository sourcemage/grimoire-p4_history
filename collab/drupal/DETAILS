A dynamic web site platform which allows an individual or community of users to publish, manage and organize a variety of content, Drupal integrates many popular features of content management systems, weblogs, collaborative tools and discussion-based community software into one easy-to-use package.

As an open source software project maintained and developed by a community, Drupal is free to download and use. If you like what you learn here, please work with us to expand and refine Drupal to suit your needs.

A wide range of site configurations

By enabling and configuring individual modules, an administrator can design a unique site, one which can be used for a combination of knowledge management, web publishing and community interaction purposes. So that you can better understand the many possibilities, the following list of features have been organized by common web platform characteristics:

    * Content management. Via a simple, browser-based interface, members can publish to a number of available content modules: stories, blogs, polls, images, forums, downloads, etc. Administrators can choose from multiple theme templates or create their own to give the site a singular look and feel. The flexible classification system allows hierarchical classifications, cross-indexing of posts and multiple category sets for most content types. Access to content is controlled through administrator-defined user permission roles. Site pages can display posts by module type or categorized content, with separate RSS feeds available for each display type. Users can also keyword search the entire site.
    * Weblog. A single installation can be configured as an individual personal weblog site or multiple individual weblogs. Drupal supports the Blogger API, provides RSS feeds for each individual blog and can be set to ping weblog directories such as blo.gs and weblogs.com when new content is posted on the home page.
    * Discussion-based community. A Drupal site can act as a Slashdot-like news site and/or make use of a traditional discussion forum. Comment boards, attached to most content types, make it simple for members to discuss new posts. Administrators can control whether content and comments are posted without approval, with administrator approval or through community moderation. With the built-in news aggregator, communites can subscribe to and then discuss content from other sites.
    * Collaboration. Used for managing the construction of Drupal, the project module is suitable for supporting other open source software projects. The wiki-like collaborative book module includes versioning control, making it simple for a group to create, revise and maintain documentation or any other type of text.
