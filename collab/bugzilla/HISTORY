	Upgraded to the coolest so far 2.17.2 straight from the source repository.

	Added optional dependency on Net-LDAP for LDAP authentication. No code
	in Bugzilla uses that, but hopefully it will in the nearest future.
	Upgraded to 2.16.1 with checksum.

	Spell created. Copies files and creates a MySQL login with necessary
	permissions.
