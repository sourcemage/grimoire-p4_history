cat << EOF
Although web2ldap is designed to be very comfortable it is today much
too powerful for unexperienced users who just want to do simple repeating
jobs like searching a specific sort of entries or adding same entries many
times. The reason is that web2ldap is a generic LDAP client providing all
kind of actions you want to do with a LDAP directory without making any
assumptions about the directory's DIT or schema.
