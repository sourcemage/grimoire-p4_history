cat << EOF
CPU is an LDAP user management tool written in C and loosely based on FreeBSD's pw(8). The goal of CPU is to be a suitable replacement of the useradd/usermod/userdel utilities for administrators using an LDAP backend and wishing to have a suite of command line tools for doing the administration.
Features:
    * TLS Support for LDAP connections
    * Account locking/unlocking
    * POSIX Support for user and group names, but allows for non-posix names to support software like Samba
    * Add additional attributes via an LDIF file
    * CPU will automatically find an unused uid/gid number when adding new users or groups, up to 780% faster than other implementations.
    * CPU allows you to use SSHA, SMD5, MD5, SHA, and Crypt for password hashes
    * CPU allows you to do both user{add|mod|del} and group{add|mod|del} actions
    * CPU allows you to add and remove users to groups (memberUid)
    * CPU allows you currently to add or delete users from an LDAP directory as defined by RFC 2307.
    * CPU allows you to take users from an existing Unix style password file and import those users into the directory with some or all of the attributes that the user had defined for them by the password entry, including their hashed password
    * CPU allows you to take a users existing encrypted password and put it into LDAP
    * Add and delete users from LDAP as well as adding/deleting home directories
    * Ability to modify all RFC2307 attributes that CPU knows about, as well as attributes it doesn't know about.
