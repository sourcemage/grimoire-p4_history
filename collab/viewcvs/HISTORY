SPELL HISTORY: viewcvs



2002-05-20 Sergey Lipnevich <sergeyli@pisem.net>
	* Patched (?) a cross-site scripting vulnerability in viewcvs.py.
	* Added a patch to copy conf files with .default suffix, now viewcvs
	  never overwrites configuration, so it's ready to be smoothly upgraded.
	  These .default files are now installed with mode 0600.
	* Earlier added a patch to ".tar.bz2" conf files, and package repository
	  tarball as .tar.bz2 instead of .tar.gz, but the resulting file is corrupted
	  when downloaded.

2002-04-11 Sergey Lipnevich <sergeyli@pisem.net>
	* Integrated patch of Alexander Belopolsky <alexb@rentec.com> for cvsdb.py
	  so that query.cgi works. This patch changes the way cvsdb.py converts time
	  string after retrieving it from a database table.

2002-04-08 Sergey Lipnevich <sergeyli@pisem.net>
	* Added semi-automatic generation of MySQL database for query.cgi and
	  corresponding viewcvs.conf entries.

2002-04-07 Sergey Lipnevich <sergeyli@pisem.net>
	* Spell created.
