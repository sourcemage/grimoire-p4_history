SPELL HISTORY: viewcvs

2002-05-20 Sergey Lipnevich <sergeyli@pisem.net>

	Patched (?) a cross-site scripting vulnerability in viewcvs.py.

	Added a patch to copy conf files with .default suffix, now viewcvs
	never overwrites configuration, so it's ready to be smoothly upgraded.
	These .default files are now installed with mode 0600.

	Earlier added a patch to ".tar.bz2" conf files, and package repository
	tarball as .tar.bz2 instead of .tar.gz, but the resulting file is corrupted
	when downloaded.

2002-04-11 Sergey Lipnevich <sergeyli@pisem.net>

	Integrated patch of Alexander Belopolsky <alexb@rentec.com> for cvsdb.py
	so that query.cgi works. This patch changes the way cvsdb.py converts time
	string after retrieving it from a database table.

2002-04-08 Sergey Lipnevich <sergeyli@pisem.net>

	Added semi-automatic generation of MySQL database for query.cgi and
	corresponding viewcvs.conf entries.

2002-04-07 Sergey Lipnevich <sergeyli@pisem.net>

	Spell created.
