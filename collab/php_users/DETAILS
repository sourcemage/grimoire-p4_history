cat << EOF
It is a project that enables users to quickly deploy a fully-functional, user
registration, email verification, user account management system to their web
site in a few easy steps. In fact this simple application enables the following
functionality:
*	user registration system - when users register, their information is stored,
	and an email is sent to them. Their account will not be activated until they
	confirm their email address
*	account management console - browse the users on your system as an
	administrator and block people's access to the site by disabling their
	account
*	provides a simple interface for users to use to edit their own account
	details and change their password
*	if users forget their password, they can request it be mailed to them
*	once a user is logged in, they receive a cookie so that they do not need to
	relogin in the future; the cookie is optionally encrypted for security
*	provided variable level access control to resources - users can be assigned
	a security level which can be used to gate access to resources or
	functionality inside your app
