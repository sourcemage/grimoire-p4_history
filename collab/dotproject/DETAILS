cat << EOF
dotproject is a PHP+MySQL beta level web based project management tool that
dotmarketing started in Dec. 2000 then left fallow for about 10 months. It is
about 50% there (there being a very high quality product, not some half-baked
simple form-into-db pages). With a little open source love, dotproject could be
an MS Project killer.

Features:
* User Management
* Email based trouble Ticket System, (Integrated voxel.net's ticketsmith)
* Client/Company Management
* Project listings
* Hierarchical Task List
* File Repository
* Contact List
* Calendar
* Discussion Forum
* Resource Based Permissions
