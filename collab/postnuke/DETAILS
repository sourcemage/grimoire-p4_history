cat << EOF
PostNuke is a content management system based on PHP-Nuke.
Well, here it is in a nutshell of where we want to get to. We want a division
of Core to Plugin files ( I'll get to this in a minute ). We want a system
that installs without a hitch, that allows you to choose what you want to
install to make your website run better and faster. That is what is on our
mind. We also want to maintain some semblance to PHP-Nuke in terms of adding
abstraction layers to allow you to be able to use all of its add-ons and
themes if you so desire.
