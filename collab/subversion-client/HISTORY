	Berkeley DB is not required for the client to operate or even
	compile, but is required for the Python bindings to function.
	Therefore, DEPENDS now will use (or ask to install) the Berkeley
	DB spell, or not use the Berkeley DB at all if it's not installed.
	In the absence of Berkeley DB, Python bindings will not work.
	TODO: replace this insane order of things with the right one.
