cat << EOF
The goal of the Subversion project is write a version control system that takes
over CVS's current and future user base 1. The first release has all the major
features of CVS, plus certain new features that CVS users often wish they had.
In general, Subversion works like CVS, except where there's a compelling reason
to be different.
This will create a monolithic Subversion client to access repository located
elsewhere on a different host.
