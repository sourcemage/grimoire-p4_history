cat << EOF
The goal of the Subversion project is write a version control system that takes
over CVS's current and future user base 1. The first release has all the major
features of CVS, plus certain new features that CVS users often wish they had.
In general, Subversion works like CVS, except where there's a compelling reason
to be different.
This will create a Subversion client binary to access repository located
elsewhere on a different host. APR (Apache Portable Runtime) and Neon libraries
will be used if they're installed, otherwise Subversion will compile and install
APR and Neon bundled with its source tarball.
