2003-09-19  Sergey Lipnevich  <sergey@sourcemage.org>
	Made Berkeley DB required dependency.

2003-08-22  hgg <hgreig@bigpond.net.au>
	Update UPDATED purely for test grimoire integration.

2003-08-01  Sergey Lipnevich  <sergey@sourcemage.org>
	It pays to read the docs: the URL supplied to slapd at startup must have three slashes.

2003-07-30  Arwed v. Merkatz <v.merkatz@gmx.net>
	Updated to new init system.

2003-07-26  Sergey Lipnevich  <sergey@sourcemage.org>
	Removed one broken mirror planetmirror.com.
	Revert init script changes, here's why. Log message or no log
	message, the SLAPD_URL that was being used achieved its purpose:
	make OpenLDAP listen on all available IP interfaces on two ports,
	LDAP and LDAPS. Guessing the host name or listening on the
	local interface only doesn't achieve this or makes things
	too complicated.

2003-07-16  Eric Sandall <eric@sandall.us>
        Now listens on localhost by default

2003-07-14  Eric Sandall <eric@sandall.us>
        Modified the init.d scripts to work by default
        (Current setup gave "Address family not supported")

2003-07-11  Eric Sandall <eric@sandall.us>
        Added some mirrors from: http://www.openldap.org/software/download/
        Upgrade to 2.1.22

2003-05-30  Sergey Lipnevich  <sergey@sourcemage.org>
	Upgrade to 2.1.21.

2003-05-27  Sergey Lipnevich  <sergey@sourcemage.org>
	Fixed output of mkaccount.sh location in mkconf.sh (thanks to Eric Sandall).

2003-05-20  Sergey Lipnevich  <sergey@sourcemage.org>
	Upgrade to 2.1.20.

2003-05-08  Sergey Lipnevich  <sergey@sourcemage.org>
	Upgrade to 2.1.19.

2003-05-02  Rob Verkuylen <rob@verkuylen.net>
	Copied /init.d/slapd.sh to /init.d/slapd
	Step 1/3 in bug#: 3115

2003-04-07  Sergey Lipnevich  <sergey@sourcemage.org>

	Upgrade to 2.1.17.
	Sort out more dependency issues.

2003-03-31  Sergey Lipnevich  <sergeyli@pisem.net>

	Upgrade to 2.1.16.

2003-03-03  Sergey Lipnevich  <sergeyli@pisem.net>

	Upgrade to 2.1.14.
	Cosmetic improvements to BUILD.
	POST_INSTALL now uses "restart" instead of "start" and checks
	configuration before restarting.
	PRE_REMOVE has been removed. The rationale here is that we don't
	need to stop the server if we remove old binaries and installing
	new ones. Rather, we need to check config and restart the server
	if the config files are fine. This gives us the benefit of the
	old server still running if we have a configuration problem. The
	admin can fix it and then restart the server. But if we stop the
	server and then see a problem, it's too late because not only the
	new server will not start, but the old one's binaries are gone.
	The disadvantage here is that "dispel" operation doesn't stop the
	server, which is OK, because in real world people don't remove
	such vital things as directory randomly.
	Correct spelling in slapd.sh.

2003-02-25  Eric Schabell <eschabell@sourcemage.org>

		Cleaned out CONFIGURE and BUILD of installscript
		calls.

2003-02-24  Eric Schabell <eschabell@sourcemage.org>

		Updated to use librunlevel for init.d script.

2003-01-07  Sergey Lipnevich  <sergeyli@pisem.net>

	Upgraded to 2.1.12, the "stable release" from now on.
	See http://www.openldap.org/software/download/.
	For definition of the "stable", see http://www.openldap.org/faq/?file=225.

2003-01-04  Sergey Lipnevich  <sergeyli@pisem.net>

	Upgraded to 2.1.11.
	Disabled Cyrus-SASL until better way to configure is available.
	Update default configuration files.

2002-10-23 Sergey Lipnevich <sergeyli@pisem.net>

	Upgraded to 2.1.8.
	Fixed minor bug in CONFIGURE which introduced major consequences.

2002-10-16 Sergey Lipnevich <sergeyli@pisem.net>

	SQL backend now compiles, thanks to suggestion by Eric Sandall (bug 1364).
	Made generation of SQL backend implicit in unixODBC depends instruction.
	Cleaned up CONFIGURE.

2002-10-14 Sergey Lipnevich <sergeyli@pisem.net>

	Upgrade to 2.1.6 with checksum.

2002-08-09 Sergey Lipnevich <sergeyli@pisem.net>

	Added dependency on Cyrus-SASL library for encrypted communication.
	Added dependencies to allow for perl and shell backends to be compiled.
	Perl dependency is commented out because of compilation problems,
	supposedly due to perl 5.8.0.

2002-07-24 Sergey Lipnevich <sergeyli@pisem.net>

	Scripts for generating default configuration have been changed to use new
	structure: ou=<Users|Groups>,dc=<company>,dc=<TLD>. They will try to guess
	the <company> and <TLD> parts from the host name.

2002-07-10 Sergey Lipnevich <sergeyli@pisem.net>

	Updated to 2.1.x tree (2.1.2) and added extra CONFIGURE options.
	Default backend will from now on be Berkeley DB (bdb). Main
	advantage of this backend is that it is transactional.
	
	Please note that there are compatibility issues between Lightweight
	DB Manager 	(LDBM) backend in 2.0.x and 2.1.x. You can backup your
	existing 2.0.x directory by exporting it entirely into LDIF format
	using ldapsearch like this:
	
	ldapsearch -D "<Root DN>" -W "(objectClass=*)" > wholedir.ldif

	You will have to enter a Root DN's password. Then, when new version
	of slapd is running, use ldapadd like this:

	ldapadd -D "<Root DN>" -W -f wholedir.ldif -c -S skipped.ldif

	Make sure slapd.conf has references to all schemas that are needed
	for your objects. E.g., an object will be skipped (and added to the
	skipped.ldif if you use the command above), if classes it belongs
	to or attributes it has, are not described by any schema.

2002-05-08 Sergey Lipnevich <sergeyli@pisem.net>

	Corrected default ldap.conf to have only one pam_password attribute,
	with value "exop", which is best for OpenLDAP.

2002-04-28 sergeyli@pisem.net

	Added code creating valid slapd.conf and ldap.conf, using files provided by
	Eric Sandall <sandalle@yahoo.com> as a guide.
	Added to slapd.conf "misc.schema" which contains some useful attributes.

2002-04-16 sergeyli@pisem.net

	Added slapd.sh, services, and BUILD files. slapd.sh for init, services for
	reference (slapd doesn't need these entries), BUILD just uses
	default_build and then installs slapd.sh along the lines of the same
	process in net/bind spell. Also added PRE_REMOVE and POST_INSTALL to take
	care of running instance of slapd when casting/dispelling.
