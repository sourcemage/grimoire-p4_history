SPELL HISTORY: openldap

2002-05-08 Sergey Lipnevich <sergeyli@pisem.net>

	Corrected default ldap.conf to have only one pam_password attribute,
	with value "exop", which is best for OpenLDAP.

2002-04-28 sergeyli@pisem.net

	Added code creating valid slapd.conf and ldap.conf, using files provided by
	Eric Sandall <sandalle@yahoo.com> as a guide.
	Added to slapd.conf "misc.schema" which contains some useful attributes.

2002-04-16 sergeyli@pisem.net

	Added slapd.sh, services, and BUILD files. slapd.sh for init, services for
	reference (slapd doesn't need these entries), BUILD just uses
	default_build and then installs slapd.sh along the lines of the same
	process in net/bind spell. Also added PRE_REMOVE and POST_INSTALL to take
	care of running instance of slapd when casting/dispelling.
