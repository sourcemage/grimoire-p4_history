SPELL HISTORY: openldap

2002-07-10 Sergey Lipnevich <sergeyli@pisem.net>

	Updated to 2.1.x tree (2.1.2) and added extra CONFIGURE options.
	Default backend will from now on be Berkeley DB (bdb). Main
	advantage of this backend is that it is transactional.
	
	Please note that there are compatibility issues between Lightweight
	DB Manager 	(LDBM) backend in 2.0.x and 2.1.x. You can backup your
	existing 2.0.x directory by exporting it entirely into LDIF format
	using ldapsearch like this:
	
	ldapsearch -D "<Root DN>" -W "(objectClass=*)" > wholedir.ldif

	You will have to enter a Root DN's password. Then, when new version
	of slapd is running, use ldapadd like this:

	ldapadd -D "<Root DN>" -W -f wholedir.ldif -c -S skipped.ldif

	Make sure slapd.conf has references to all schemas that are needed
	for your objects. E.g., an object will be skipped (and added to the
	skipped.ldif if you use the command above), if classes it belongs
	to or attributes it has, are not described by any schema.

2002-05-08 Sergey Lipnevich <sergeyli@pisem.net>

	Corrected default ldap.conf to have only one pam_password attribute,
	with value "exop", which is best for OpenLDAP.

2002-04-28 sergeyli@pisem.net

	Added code creating valid slapd.conf and ldap.conf, using files provided by
	Eric Sandall <sandalle@yahoo.com> as a guide.
	Added to slapd.conf "misc.schema" which contains some useful attributes.

2002-04-16 sergeyli@pisem.net

	Added slapd.sh, services, and BUILD files. slapd.sh for init, services for
	reference (slapd doesn't need these entries), BUILD just uses
	default_build and then installs slapd.sh along the lines of the same
	process in net/bind spell. Also added PRE_REMOVE and POST_INSTALL to take
	care of running instance of slapd when casting/dispelling.
