# There's an issue when SLAPD_URL (with spaces in value), ARGS,
# and "$@" expansion come together in simpleinit scripts. The
# fact that current code doesn't produce the expected result
# (OpenLDAP listens on ldap: but not on ldaps:) is acknowledged
# (by me, Sergey Lipnevich, as a maintainer) and I'm working on
# resolving this. This code, however, is the best effort not to
# produce errors during SLAPD start, so please don't change the
# value below without testing it thoroughly.
