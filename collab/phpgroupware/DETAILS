phpGroupWare (formerly known as webdistro) is a pluggable, multi-user
groupware suite written in PHP.

It provides a Web-based calendar, todo-list, addressbook, email, news
headlines, and a file manager. The calendar supports repeating events.  The
email system supports inline graphics and file attachments.

The system as a whole supports user preferences, themes, user permissions,
multi-language support, an advanced API, and user groups.

phpGroupWare (phpgw) is many things.  It is a very flexible pluggable
framework capable of hosting applications like a group calendar, AddressBook,
email, accounting ledger, inventory, and whatever else your can think of.
These applications can share a common user store, and a flexible Access
Control List (ACL) system to control access and information sharing.

At it's core there is the phpgwapi, an API written for php, that provides some
very useful functions and tools for developers, including the user store,
which has several back ends, database abstraction, and a flexible templating
system.  Applications are then written using the phpgwapi and phpgw framework
to provide web based tools to users.
