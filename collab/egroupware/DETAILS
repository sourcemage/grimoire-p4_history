eGroupWare is a groupware suite like Notes/Domino but open source. It is not simply a calender with notes and 
to-dos and email like Microsoft Exchange.

eGroupWare is a flexible pluggable framework capable of hosting applications like a group calender, address 
book, email, infolog (notes, to-dos, phone calls), content management, trouble ticket system, forum, and more. 
These applications can share a common user store and a flexible access control list (ACL) system to control 
access and information sharing.

The core of eGroupWare is the groupware API written in PHP. eGW API includes a user store, has several back 
ends, and offers database abstraction and a flexible templating system.
