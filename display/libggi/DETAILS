GGI stands for "General Graphics Interface", and it is a project that
aims to develop a reliable, stable and fast graphics system that works
everywhere. We want to allow any program using GGI to run on any
platform requiring at most a recompile.

It all started out with some people being annoyed by the fact that
graphics in Linux means either X or svgalib, and if you use both at
the same time, you can easily crash the graphics card and make the
system unusable. Nowadays, GGI development also involves a portable
userspace library, 3D graphics, and anything else that is fun to hack
:-)
