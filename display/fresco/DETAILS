Fresco is a consistent, configurable, stand alone, modular, and device
independent user interface system, formerly known as Berlin. Fresco is based
on the concept of a server side scene graph. It uses CORBA, which results in
the whole system being network- and language transparent. To access input
and output devices low-level graphic libraries are used.
