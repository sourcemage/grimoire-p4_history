           SHORT='gdk-pixbuf compatible engine for gtk+2-directfb'

cat << EOF
A GTK+ theme engine based on the gdk-pixbuf pixmap theme engine.
The config files are compatible, but this spell uses directfb for
the rendering, which makes it much faster, especially when
your graphics card is supported by directfb.
