Swami (Sample Waveforms and Audio for Magical Instruments) is a MIDI
patch file editor which currently supports SoundFont files.
SoundFont files are a collection of audio samples and
other data that describe instruments for the purpose of composing
music. SoundFont files do not describe the music itself, but rather the
sounds of the instruments. These instruments can be composed of any
digitally recordable or generated sound. This format provides a
portable and flexible sound synthesis environment that can be
supported in hardware or software.
