Sweep is an audio wave editor and live playback tool that supports ladspa
plug-ins. It supports many music and voice formats including WAV, AIFF, 
Ogg Vorbis and Speex with multichannel editing and ladspa effects plug-in 
support. Inside sweep lives a virtual stylus called Scrubby. You can drag 
him around any digital audio file just like dragging the stylus around on 
a vinyl record.
