Ardour is a multichannel hard disk recorder (HDR) and digital audio 
workstation (DAW). It is capable of simultaneous recording of 24 or more 
channels of 32 bit audio at 48kHz. Ardour is intended to function as a 
professional HDR system, replacing dedicated hardware solutions such as 
the Mackie HDR, the Tascam 2424 and more traditional tape systems like 
the Alesis ADAT series. It is also intended to provide the same or 
better functionality as proprietary software DAWs such as ProTools, 
Samplitude, Logic Audio, Nuendo and Cubase VST/SX. It supports MIDI 
Machine Control, and so can be controlled from any MMC controller, such 
as the Mackie Digital 8 Bus mixer and many other modern digital mixers. 
Ardour can operate as an MTC slave or master, allowing synchronization 
with various MTC and SMPTE devices
