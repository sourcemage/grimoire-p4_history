Ecamegapedal is a real-time effect processor software with a graphical user interface for controlling the effect parameters. It is meant to be used as a virtual guitar-fx or studio effect box. In addition to real-time operation, Ecamegapedal also supports reading from and writing to audio files. All audio object and effect plugin types provided by the Ecasound libraries are supported. This includes ALSA, JACK, OSS, aRts, over 20 file formats, over 30 effect types, LADSPA plugins and multi-operator effect presets. Ecamegapedal's implementation is based on Ecasound and Qt libraries.
