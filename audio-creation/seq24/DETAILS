Seq24 is a real-time midi sequencer. It was created to provide a very 
simple interface for editing and playing midi 'loops'. After 
searching for a software based sequencer that would provide the 
functionality needed for a live techno performance, such as the Akai 
MPC line, the Kawai Q80 sequencer, or the popular Alesis MMT-8, I 
found nothing similar in the software realm. I set out to create a 
very minimal sequencer that excludes the bloated features of the 
large software sequencers, and includes a small subset of features 
that I have found usable in performing.
