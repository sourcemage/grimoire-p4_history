Cheesetracker is a portable Impulse Tracker clone. It supports all 
Impulse Tracker features except a few. For now the main goal is to 
remain at IT Feature set level, but very soon we might be adding new 
features to it.

Supported features include:

-Modular source code
-Per-track lowpass filter (cutoff/resonance), with greater range than 
IT.
-Per-instrument modular effect core (own effects/and ladspa) (WIP!)
-Wave export (dump your song to wavs and post process) (WIP!)
-Super-Clean mixing using the CheeseMusic lib.
-All IT editing shortcuts (or most of them)
-Very cool sample editor
