Spectroscopic Toolkit provides 64 bit integer DSP for massive additive 
synthesis or granular synthesis. It generates audio files and graphic 
image files. It was not designed for realtime synthesis, and does not 
offer a graphical user interface. I developed it because other rendering 
software (like CSound) did no longer suffice my needs.
