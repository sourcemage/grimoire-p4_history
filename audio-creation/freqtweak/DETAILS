FreqTweak is a tool for FFT-based realtime audio spectral manipulation 
and display. It provides several algorithms for processing audio data in 
the frequency domain and a highly interactive GUI to manipulate the 
associated filters for each. It also provides high-resolution spectral 
displays in the form of scrolling-raster spectrograms and energy vs 
frequency plots displaying both pre- and post-processed spectra.
