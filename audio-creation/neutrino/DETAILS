cat << EOF
Neutrino (formerly GnomeDAP) is a GNOME 2 (and hence GTK 2) based
application. The actually jukebox communication code was derived from that of
GNOMAD but wrapped up into a GObject so I don't have nasty global variables
around. Due to this GnomeDAP can theoretically support multiple jukeboxes at
once, something which I don't think GNOMAD is capable of due to the way it is
written. (but then who has 2 jukeboxes plugged into a machine at once).
