Denemo is a unique score editor which exports notation to LilyPond and ABC music formats. It also acts as a frontend for Csound score files. Denemo is different from most graphic music editors, this is partly because it was created to help edit Lilypond notation and partly because of its unique design philosophy.

LilyPond is a music typesetting system which uses definition files written in plain text and outputs beautiful music. Please see the LilyPond homepage for more information about LilyPond.

Denemo tries to mimic the speed of notation entry in Lilypond as much as possible. Denemo sports a clean uncluttered interface with a very keyboard centric bent. This makes score creation with Denemo both quick and intuitive.
