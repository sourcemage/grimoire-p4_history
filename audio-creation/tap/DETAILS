           SHORT="TAP stands for Tom's Audio Plugins. It is a bunch of 
LADSPA plugins for digital audio processing, intended for use in a 
professional DAW environment such as Ardour."
cat << EOF
The plugins have been developed with Ardour as a primary host in 
mind, but they should be usable within any LADSPA-capable host. The 
main issue here is that LADSPA plugins don't generate their own GUIs, 
but the GUIs are generated by the host. Therefore the arrangement and 
appearance of the controls may vary using another host. When longer 
texts are required to be displayed to the user (see the list of 
presets in the TAP Reverberator plugin for an example), the strings 
have been optimized to be good-looking in Ardour. On other hosts, 
these strings may look crappy because the amount of padding spaces 
will be incorrect using another font (to mention one possible 
defect). However, no audio processing ability is involved, so the 
plugins should perform the same way even with a somewhat crappy GUI.
