GnomeDAP is a GNOME 2 (and hence GTK 2) based application. The actually jukebox communication code was derived from that of GNOMAD but wrapped up into a GObject so I don't have nasty global variables around. Due to this GnomeDAP can theoretically support multiple jukeboxes at once, something which I don't think GNOMAD is capable of due to the way it is written. (but then who has 2 jukeboxes plugged into a machine at once).
