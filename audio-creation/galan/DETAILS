Using gAlan is much like setting up an effects-chain for, say, a guitar. 
You choose the effects units you wish to use, lay them out, and then 
connect them to each other, starting with the guitar, threading through 
the effects, and ending up at the amplifier (and ultimately the 
speakers). 

It's not just limited to acting as an effects-chain, though. You can 
also configure it (using the same basic principles) to act as a mixer, a 
sample-sequencer or drum machine, or a synthesiser capable of emulating 
various analogue systems.
