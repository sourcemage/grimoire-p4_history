cat << EOF
The Bonobo Configuration System (BCS) consists of several parts. An API
to access configuration data, a database to store configuration values
in XML format and a system to visualise and edit configuration data. The
whole system is built on top of bonobo and ORBit (CORBA). There are
several APIs to access the configuration data, and the API can be chosen
through the bonobo moniker system. It is up to the programmer to decide
which interface is best for a given application. The configuration 
system allows you to store the data with various backends. Although BCS
is shipped with it's own XML based backend, it is also possible to use
GConf, or LDAP as backend. The configuration database architecture is a
reimplementation of the GConf architecture developed by Havoc Pennington
using Bonobo-native idioms. Some configuration systems only permit you
to store a limited set of types. We have removed that limitation so that
we can now store CORBA:any which is very convenient in some situations.
