bonobo-activation is the new name for OAF under GNOME 2.0

OAF was designed as a replacement for the limited libgnorba library
used in GNOME. libgnorba is responsible on GNOME 1.0.x and 1.2.x systems
for the activation of CORBA objects. libgnorba allows you to browse the
available CORBA servers on your system (running or not). It keeps track
of the running servers so that if you ask for a server which is already
running, you will not start it again but will reuse the already running
one.
