cat << EOF
Libart is a library of functions for 2D graphics supporting a
superset of the PostScript imaging model, designed to be integrated
with graphics, artwork, and illustration programs. It is written in
optimized C, and is fully compatible with C++. With a small
footprint of 10,000 lines of code, it is especially suitable for
embedded applications. Libart is currently being used in several free
software applications, including Gill (the Gnome SVG editor),
the Gnome Canvas, and several others under development.
