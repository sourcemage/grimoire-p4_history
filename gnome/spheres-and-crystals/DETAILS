cat << EOF
Spheres and Crystals SVG is a metatheme for GNOME 2.2 we developed 
to test the limits of librsvg. The aim of this theme is to eventually 
only use SVG files. Currently that is only partially true as the GTK+ 
theme and the Metacity theme are using pixmaps, but we hope to fix 
this in a later release.

The Spheres and Crystals theme uses icons or part of icons from many 
resources. The buttons in the GUI uses the BlueSphere SVG icons and 
the filesystem icons are a mix of Crystal SVG, BlueSphere and parts 
taken from Gorilla SVG theme. A big thanks goes to Vadim Plessky, 
Everaldo Coelho and Jakub 'Jimmac' Steiner who are the primary forces 
behind these icon sets.
