cat << EOF
Spheres and Crystals SVG is a metatheme for GNOME 2.2 we developed to test the limits of librsvg. The aim of this theme is to eventually only use SVG files. Currently that is only partially true as the GTK+ theme and the Metacity theme are using pixmaps, but we hope to fix this in a later release.

The Spheres and Crystals theme uses icons or part of icons from many resources. The buttons in the GUI uses the BlueSphere SVG icons and the filesystem icons are a mix of Crystal SVG, BlueSphere and parts taken from Gorilla SVG theme. A big thanks goes to Vadim Plessky, Everaldo Coelho and Jakub 'Jimmac' Steiner who are the primary forces behind these icon sets.
