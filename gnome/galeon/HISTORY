		Added this History file and updated version to 1.2.0:
		* This release requires Mozilla 0.9.9. It features favicon speedups, a
                better crash recovery dialog, and fixed memory leaks. It also has new
                smart bookmarks and "Properties" and "Page Info" windows. Favicons are
                now shown in tabs. Changes in the preferences are now automatically
                applied. There is a new bookmarks removal confirmation dialog, session
                autosave improvements, and mouse gesture support. A "Copy email
                address" context menu item has been added, as well as a native
                JavaScript console, and new preference window icons. Also, a lot of
                other improvements and bugfixes have been made.
