cat << EOF
Gtk+Licq is a fully featured gui-plugin for Licq. It started out as almost
identical to the Qt-gui with a few extensions, but today we have evolved
and are not just a QT-gui clone. The goal for this project was to create
a usable gtk-gui for Licq, then enhance it.
To run Licq with the gtk-gui just type 'licq -p gtk_gui'
