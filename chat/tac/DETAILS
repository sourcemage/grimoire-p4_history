cat << EOF
TAC is a pure Tcl console-based version of AOL Instant Messenger (AIM). The TAC client began as a console-only alternative to TiK, the Tcl/Tk client. Since most development efforts were focused on TiK, the TAC client has relatively few features. Eventually, the client will have many or all of the featrues the native Windows and Macintosh clients have. TAC is now maintained by Mike LoPresti, and is no longer part of the TiK project.
