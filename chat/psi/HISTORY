		New version, works with automake and is
		on sourceforge, so here is 0.8.7!

		New spell added, note that the source must be
		pulled by hand for now, the url is flaky (anyone
		have any idea how to get summon to parse it correctly?).

		Just get source with browser and place in /var/spool/sorcery
		and recast spell.
