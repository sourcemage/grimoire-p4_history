Bashish is a theme engine for the console.
It lets you customize title, prompt, background, foreground, colors, 
font and a lot of other things. Bashish is also very configurable, 
you can turn on and off nearly all features.
A large collection of themes, including "classic" os-themes, artistic 
themes, functional is attatched to the package.
All themes are switched on the fly by using the "changetheme" command, 
you don't need to restart the terminal for changes to take effect.
Bashish aims to be easy to use even for the novice user.
