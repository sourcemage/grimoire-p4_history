cat << EOF
qlogin is a program that can be used to cause a terminal (usually a
virtual console) to be logged in automatically, without having to type a
userid and password. Stick it in place of getty in /etc/inittab to have
terminals come up logged in and at a shell prompt at every boot. Same
purpose as 'alogin', but you use it a little differently, and it does a
little more of the usual login stuff. It is a simple Perl program, and
can be easily customized.
