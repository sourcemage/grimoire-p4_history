aterm (AfterStep term) is an xterm replacement, based on rxvt
v.2.4.8. It includes features such as NeXT style scrollbar, resource
efficient pseudo-transparency. It understands root background changes 
by AfterStep Pager and Esetroot. The primary goal of aterm is to
provide cool visual features without resource consumption. It can be
compiled to utilize AfterStep's libasimage for wider image format
support.
