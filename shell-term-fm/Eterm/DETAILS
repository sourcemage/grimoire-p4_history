cat << EOF
Eterm is a vt102 terminal emulator intended as a replacement for
xterm. It is designed with a Freedom of Choice philosophy, leaving as
much power, flexibility, and freedom as possible in the hands of the
user. It is designed to look good and work well, but takes a
feature-rich approach rather than one of minimalism. Current features
include color support, background images (all Imlib-supported
formats), theme support, and pseudo-transparency.
