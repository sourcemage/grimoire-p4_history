cat << EOF
For those, who know the Windows Commander there is nothing to explain. Largely speaking,
it is the ultimate tool, not only for file management. We don?t know anything like this,
in the whole Linux world.(anyhow not with KDE Front-end)

A highlight would be the automatic (un-)mounting of dynamic drives like CD-Rom or Floppy.
Furthermore all the points you want configurable can be changed to satisfy different tasts.
You can handle packed archives like normal lists. And so on ...
