cat << EOF
Fm is a gtk+ file manager which aims to offer the 
best possible ratio between features, simplicity 
and resource usage. It includes advanced features 
such as character browsing, popup menus, tab 
completion, bookmarks, pan navigation, multiple 
windows, redefinable and stored keyboard shortcuts, 
integration with the X clipboard and drag & drop.

The interface is simple, yet full-featured, offering 
a well-balanced mixture of the Macintosh ? finder 
and classic two-paned filemanagers such as Directory
Opus.
