           SHORT="splitvt splits a terminal window vertically into two shell windows."
cat << EOF
splitvt takes any VT100 terminal window and splits it vertically into
two shell windows. It allows you to watch two terminal sessions at once,
which can be very useful whenever you want more screen real-estate
without messing with windows.
