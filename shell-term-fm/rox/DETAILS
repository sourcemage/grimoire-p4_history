    * Uncluttered display (popup menus are used throughout),
    * Background file operations (copy, move, link, delete, permissions, find),
    * Powerful expression-based find feature with on-line quick reference
      (eg 'mtime after 2 days ago and size > 10Mb' finds files based on their
      modification time and size)
    * Mounts and unmounts filesystems (just Shift-Click on the mount point),
    * Supports the XDND protocol, which provides for drag-and-drop file
      loading, and the new XDS extension which allows drag-and-drop saving,
    * VFS support allows browsing around inside zip files
      (and other types of archive),
    * Fully configurable from the Options dialog box,
    * User-defined key bindings for all menu entries,
    * A pop-up minibuffer allows navigating the filesystem using
      shell-style tab completion,
    * The minibuffer can also be used for quickly entering shell commands,
    * Full manual provided (HTML format)
