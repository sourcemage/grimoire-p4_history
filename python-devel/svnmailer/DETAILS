cat << EOF
Svnmailer is a tool to post subversion repository commit information by mail,
news or XML (to a CIA tracker).

The svnmailer package is derived from the script mailer.py distributed with
subversion. It arose from the idea to add some features to the original mailer
script. But I've found the script not as extensible as it could be, so the
svnmailer package was redeveloped from scratch with clearer design and
extensibility in mind. Now there are additional features like property diffs,
MIME encoding, configurable handling of huge mails and news postings, subject
templates, consistent unicode handling and even a better extensible command
line. You'll find a complete description of the svnmailer and its possibilities
in the documentation.
