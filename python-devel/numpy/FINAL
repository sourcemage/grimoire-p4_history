The previous version of numpy used the the Numeric source cdoe.

Numeric was the first arrayobject built for Python.  It has been quite successful and is used in 
a wide variety of settings and applications.   Development for Numeric has ceased, and users 
should transisition to NumPy as quickly as possible.   There is a module called convertcode.py 
in NumPy that can make the transition to NumPy easier (it will automatically perform the 
search-and-replace style changes that need to be made to python code that uses Numeric to make 
it work with NumPy).
