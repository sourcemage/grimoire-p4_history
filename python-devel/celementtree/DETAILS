cat << EOF
The cElementTree module is a C implementation of the ElementTree API. On typical
documents, it's 15-20 times faster than the Python version of ElementTree, and
uses 2-5 times less memory. On modern hardware, that means that documents in
the 50-100 megabyte range can be manipulated in memory, and that documents in
the 0-1 megabyte range load in zero time (0.0 seconds). This allows you to
drastically simplify many kinds of XML applications.
