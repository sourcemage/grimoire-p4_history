Set of plugins for bzr:

* BAZ-IMPORT
  baz-bzr will import an Arch or Baz branch into bzr.
  Data converted:
  - source tree
  - file ids
  - revision ids
  - log summaries

* Data not converted:
  - data on revisions merged
  - log bodies
  - symlinks in Arch trees are not handled (but can be skipped).

  After more commits are made to the baz/arch branch, you can re-run baz-import
  to import just those changes.

  The conversion algorithm is still in flux, and old data may become invalid as
  newer conversion functionality is introduced.


* PUSH
  Uses rsync to copy a branch to a remote location.  Remembers the last location
  used.  Will not push if
  - there are unknown files
  - there are uncommitted changes in the working tree.
  These safeguards are intended to prevent dirty trees from being uploaded.

* ANNOTATE
  Output a version of the requested file that indicates which revision
  introduced each line.

* SHELVE/UNSHELVE
  Temporarily put aside some changes, to restore them later.  This can be useful
  to separate two sets of changes, so that they can be committed separately.

* CLEAN-TREE
  Delete unknown (or, optionally, ignored) files, leaving versioned files
  untouched.

* CONFLICTS
  List files in the tree that have conflicts.

* RESOLVE
  Mark conflicts as resolved, by deleting TREE, BASE and OTHER files.

* GRAPH-ANCESTRY
  Use dot (from Graphviz) to produce graphics of a tree's ancestry.

* FETCH-MISSING
  Scan this branch for missing ancestors, and attempt to retrieve them from
  another branch

* PATCH
  Use patch to apply a patch to this tree.
