cat << EOF
Nevow is a next-generation web application templating system, based on 
the ideas developed in the Twisted Woven package. Its main focus is on 
separating the HTML template from both the business logic and the 
display logic, while allowing the programmer to write pure Python code 
as much as possible. It separates your code into 'data' and 'render' 
functions, a simplified implementation of traditional MVC. It has 
various parts which can be used individually or as a whole, integrated 
web solution:

        * XHTML templates: contain no programming logic, only nodes 
tagged with nevow attributes
        * data/render methods: simplified MVC
        * stan: An s-expression-like syntax for expressing xml in pure 
python
        * formless: For describing the types of objects which may be 
passed to methods of your classes, validating and coercing string input 
from either web or command-line sources, and calling your methods 
automatically once validation passes
        * formless.webform: For rendering web forms based on formless 
type descriptions, accepting form posts and passing them to formless 
validators, and rendering error forms in the event validation fails
        * livepage: Cross-browser JavaScript glue for sending client 
side events to the server and server side events to the client after the 
page has loaded, without causing the entire page to refresh
