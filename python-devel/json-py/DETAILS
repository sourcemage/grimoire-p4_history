cat << EOF
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format. It
is easy for humans to read and write. It is easy for machines to parse and
generate. It is based on a subset of the JavaScript Programming Language,
Standard ECMA-262 3rd Edition - December 1999. JSON is a text format that is
completely language independent but uses conventions that are familiar to
programmers of the C-family of languages, including C, C++, C#, Java,
JavaScript, Perl, Python, and many others. These properties make JSON an ideal
data-interchange language.
