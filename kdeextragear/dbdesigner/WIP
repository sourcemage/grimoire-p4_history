Okay I think this is a good project that is worth looking at but the guy sucks at coding... jk

I had to do a lot of diffs mainly because he used an older version of kdelibs kdesdk and kdevelop...

configure.diff removes the reference to kdb2html

dbdesign.Makefile.*.diff are for the kfile being move, had to find that one...

also metaseqedit.h.diff is there... check out the website it has a comment about it...

Note: It looks like on systems with qt compiled without kde support DbDesigner fails to compile. If you get errors about "invalid use of undefined type `class KIntSpinBox'" when compiling, please add "#include <knuminput.h>" at the beginning of dbdesign/metaseqedit.h. This will be fixed in the future release, sorry about it. Thanks to Lefebvre Herve for reporting this bug.

It compiles and installs but it doesn't work for me... so if someone could test this that would be great
