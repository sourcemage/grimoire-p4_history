	This is Release 1.5 of a set of 3-D widgets based 
    on the R6.1/R6.3/R6.4 Athena Widget set.  The Three-D Athena may be 
    used as a general replacement for the Athena (Xaw) Widget set.

    In general, you may relink almost any Athena Widget based application 
    with the Three-D Athena Widget set and obtain a three dimensional 
    appearance on some of the widgets. On systems with shared libraries, 
    you can usually replace your shared libXaw with libXaw3d and obtain 
    the three dimensional appearance without even relinking.

    Top and bottom shadow colors, shadow width, top and bottom shadow 
    contrast should be self explanatory, and may be set via the usual 
    and customary methods, e.g. app-defaults, .Xdefaults, programmatically, 
    with editres, etc.  The user data resource may be used to "hang" 
    application specific data on a widget, and is only settable 
    programmatically.
