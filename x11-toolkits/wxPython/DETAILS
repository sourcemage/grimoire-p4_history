wxPython is a GUI toolkit for the Python programming language. It allows 
Python programmers to create programs with a robust, highly functional 
graphical user interface, simply and easily. It is implemented as a Python
extension module (native code) that wraps the popular wxWindows cross 
platform GUI library, which is written in C++.
