           SHORT="The XForms GUI toolkit"
cat << EOF
This is the first Open Source distribution of the XForms Library, a
graphical user interface toolkit for X Window Systems.  It should be
considered "provisional".  Hence the Version 0.9999.  There should be
several more 9's following the decimal point.

Also included in this package is a GUI designer meant to help you design
interaction dialogues in a WYSIWYG way and write the corresponding C code.

The binary distributions of XForms will at some time in the future be
deleted from the server.  Effective immediately, they are considered
unmaintained deprecated versions. - 2002 04 04
