SHORT="easy-to-use, compact and effective library of controls to extend FLTK"
cat << EOF
The goal of this library is to create the easy-to-use, compact and effective library 
of controls to extend the abilities of FLTK library. Most of the controls are 
database-bound. If you place them on the CDialog-derived window they can load and 
save information from/to database.
