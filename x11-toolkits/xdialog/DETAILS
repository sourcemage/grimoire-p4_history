cat << EOF
Xdialog is designed to be a drop in replacement for the 
'dialog' or 'cdialog' programs. It converts any terminal 
based program into a program with an X-windows interface.
The dialogs are easier to see and use while adding even 
more functionality (e.g. with the treeview, the file 
selector, the edit box, the range box, the help button/box).
