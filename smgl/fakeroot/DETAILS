cat << EOF
Fakeroot runs a command in an environment were it appears to have root
privileges for file manipulation, by setting LD_PRELOAD to a library with
alternative versions of getuid(), stat(), etc. This is useful for allowing
users to create archives (tar, ar, .deb .rpm etc.) with files in them with
root permissions/ownership. Without fakeroot one would have to have root
privileges to create the constituent files of the archives with the correct
permissions and ownership, and then pack them up, or one would have to
construct the archives directly, without using the archiver.
