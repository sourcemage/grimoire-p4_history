This spell installs bashdoc tooling for generationg Bash documentation from
code. It also runs a script generate and install all Source Mage GNU/Linux
documentation that is available in our code. Documentation is viewable at 
/usr/doc/sourcemage-docs/index.html. Enjoy!

bashdoc.sh:
==========
Parses comments between lines of '#---' Lines to be parsed start with ##. All 
tags start with @. Lines without a tag are considered simple description of 
the section. If the line following the comment block doesn't start with 'function' 
the it's assumed that the comment is for the whole file. Only the first non-function 
comment block will be used, the other will be ignored. 

Multiple identical tags are allowed, the contents are appended and separated with a 
space. @param tags are treated specials and are assumed to be in order. 

There is an additional <@function FUNCTION_NAME> tag that can be embeded in any b
ashdoc comment. It will be transformed into a link to that function. Note, this will 
only work for functions that are defined in the same script. 


Usage: [-p project] [-o directory] [-e tag] [--] script [ script ...]
'-p project' Name of the project
'-o directory' Specifies the directory you want the
resulting html to go into
'-e tag' Only output if the block has this tag
'-q' Quiet things down
'--' No more arguments, only scripts
'script' The script you want documented
