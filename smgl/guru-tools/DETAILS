There are various useful tools that have been written by Source Mage
developers over the years. Here we have bundled them together for your
Guru experience:

dependsSquish.sh        -  takes a list of spells and outputs the order in which to 
                           cast them so dependancies are taken care of.

                          one or more items. Items may be either spells or sections.

                          missing spells. (by Paul)

historyfix.pl           - outputs an sh script for editing and patching all the history
                          problems in a grimoire, section, spell. When you've tried it 
                          once and checked its output, just pipe it into sh and then p4 
                          submit. 
                          historyfix.pl with no arguments does the current directory 
                          recursively. 
                          historyfix.pl with arguments does only the files
                          supplied in the args. (by Seth Woolley)
                          
image.sh <grimoire-path> - print a grimoire image. This script is used to
                          create images for the report.pl tool listed below.
                          Try piping output as follows: '| tee <file.image>'
                          and then pass the files to report.pl below. (by
                          Andrew Stitt)

                          the image.sh tool and report the differences,
                          amazing amount of information! (see image.sh above)

                          then scribe reindex ${MYGRIMOIRE}. Uses 
                          /etc/sorcery/local/guruinfo for guru info.

summonsection           - usefull for lazy section maintainters who get bored
                          first deleting cached files, then summon'em one by
                          one, by hand. Summonsection kills cached files, and
                          summons new files automaticaly. (by M.L.).

update_spell            - typical parameters are "DETAILS -s -m -v 1.2.3",
                          it only works on the first SOURCE for now.
                          (from our old CVS repository)

upspell                 - updates a spell DETAILS and HISTORY.
                          Just goes to the spell's directory and run it...
                          Uses /etc/sorcery/local/guruinfo for guru info.

urlwatch                - checks a list of urls for changes inside html page.
                          Make a cronjob with this and you'll automaticaly
                          receive notifications for changed urls by email... 
                          See urlwatch --help for help. (by M.L.).
