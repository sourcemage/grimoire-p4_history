There are various useful tools that have been written by Source Mage
developers over the years. Here we have bundled them together for your
Guru experience:

findSharedFiles        - A tool for finding files shared between spells.
                         (by Rasmus Ory Nielsen) 

gazeSpider [<item ...] - Validates urls for entire grimoire or if item
                         give, for one or more items. Items may be
                         either spells or sections.

md5unpack <tarball>     - provides md5sum info from source tarball. 

urlwatch                - This script check a list of urls for changes inside 
                          html page. Make a cronjob with this and you'll
                          automaticaly receive notifications for changed
                          urls by email... 
                          See urlwatch --help for help. (by M.L.).

spellify                - takes some software-version.tar.{gz|bz2}, makes a
                          #{MYSPELLS}/software and DETAILS in your local 
                          spell dir ${MYSPELLS} and cp the tarball to spool 
                          then scribe reindex ${MYGRIMOIRE}. Uses 
                          /etc/sorcery/local/guruinfo for guru info.

summonsection           - This script is usefull for lazy section
                          maintainters who get bored first deleting cached
                          files, then summon'em one by one, by hand.
                          Summonsection kills cached files, and summons
                          new files automaticaly. (by M.L.).

upspell                 - This script updates a spell DETAILS and HISTORY.
                          Just goes to the spell's directory and run it...
                          Uses /etc/sorcery/local/guruinfo for guru info.

update_spell            - Typical parameters are "DETAILS -s -m -v 1.2.3",
                          it only works on the first SOURCE for now.
                          (from our old CVS repository)

rebuildPackages.sh      - package rebuilding tool, helps with package file 
                          rescue. (by Paul)

bashdoc.sh              - a script to convert javadoc-like commented script to 
                          nicely formated html. (by Paul)

src2html.sh             - creates an HTML version of the source and links instances 
                          of functions with the functions in the bashdoc generated 
                          HTML. It also modifies the bashdoc generated documentation 
                          to link to the HTML'ised source. There is undefined 
                          behaviour when a function is defined in more that one 
                          source file. (by Paul)
