developers over the years. Here we have bundled them together for your
Guru experience:

                         give, for one or more items. Items may be

                          html page. Make a cronjob with this and you'll
                          automaticaly receive notifications for changed
                          urls by email... 
                          See urlwatch --help for help. (by M.L.).

                          #{MYSPELLS}/software and DETAILS in your local 
                          spell dir ${MYSPELLS} and cp the tarball to spool 
                          then scribe reindex ${MYGRIMOIRE}. Uses 
                          /etc/sorcery/local/guruinfo for guru info.

summonsection           - This script is usefull for lazy section
                          maintainters who get bored first deleting cached
                          files, then summon'em one by one, by hand.
                          Summonsection kills cached files, and summons
                          new files automaticaly. (by M.L.).

                          Just goes to the spell's directory and run it...
                          Uses /etc/sorcery/local/guruinfo for guru info.

                          it only works on the first SOURCE for now.
