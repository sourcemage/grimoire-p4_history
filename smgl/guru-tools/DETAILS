There are various useful tools that have been written by Source Mage
developers over the years. Here we have bundled them together for your
Guru experience:

  findSharedFiles			- A tool for finding files shared between spells.
							  (by Rasmus Ory Nielsen) 

  gazeSpider [<item ...]	- Validates urls for entire grimoire or if item
  							  give, for one or more items. Items may be either 
							  spells or sections.

  md5unpack <tarball>		- provides md5sum info from source tarball. 

  urlwatch					- This script check a list of urls for changes inside 
  							  html page. Make a cronjob with this and you'll automaticaly 
							  receive notifications for changed urls by email... 
							  See urlwatch --help for help. (by M.L.).

  summonsection				- This script is usefull for lazy section maintainters who 
							  get bored first deleting cached files, then summon'em one 
							  by one, by hand. Summonsection kills cached files, and summons 
							  new files automaticaly. (by M.L.).

  upspell					- This script updates a spell DETAILS and HISTORY. Just goes to 
  							  the spell's directory and run it... (by M.L.).

  update_spell				- Typical parameters are "DETAILS -s -m -v 1.2.3", it only works 
  							  on the first SOURCE for now. (from our old CVS repository)

If you have more to contribute, mail to maintainer.
