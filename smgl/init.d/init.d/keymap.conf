# This variable contains include keymaps to be loaded.
INCLUDEMAPS=

# Below are arguments passed to the consolechars and kbd programs. You 
# may wish to use this setting to change the console font and charmap 
# settings.
# Only one of these variables is used depending on which program you 
# have installed. (consolechars is installed by the console-tools spell 
# and kbd by the kbd spell.)
# For example to setup Frech font and charmap with consolechars use:
#  CONSOLECHARS_ARGS="-f lat1-16 -m iso15"
# Synonymous arguments for setfont are:
#  SETFONT_ARGS="lat1-16 -m 8859-15"
CONSOLECHARS_ARGS=
SETFONT_ARGS=

# This variable contains numbers of console nodes in /dev/ on which
# fonts and charmap given in CONSOLECHARS_ARGS and SETFONT_ARGS will be 
# set. If value "*" is given, settings will be enabled on all available 
# console nodes.
# (Notice: this variable needs to be defined for font and unicode 
# settings to take effect.)
TTY_NUMS=

# This variable tells the keymap.sh script to run unicode_start or not
# It can be either on or cleared to unset it
UNICODE_START=
