The scripts that have been setup to install properly with the init.d
spell are kept in the scriptdir/ directory. As new scripts are updated,
they will be added to the que. This way, you will not need to recast
the spell to get the updated scripts. Also, the init.d spell sets up 
the run levels and priorities for these scripts.
