2003-05-20  Eric Sandall <eric@sandall.us>

		the code to handle the LFS filenames yet

2003-05-09  Eric Schabell <eschabell@sourcemage.org>

		Moved mountall back to mount and patched with
		support for raid mounting if avail. Fixes bug
		#3069. Also moved all .sh files properly thru
		integrating so that history moves with files.

2003-05-01  Rob Verkuylen <rob@verkuylen.net>

		Copied /init.d/alsasound.sh to /init.d/alsa

		Step 1/3 in bug#: 3115

2003-03-31  Eric Sandall <eric@sandall.us>

		Moving scripts to appropriate spells, now
		recasting those spells will install the scripts,
		rather than always having them there, even if
		they are not needed.  Also better records what
		the scripts are for/from

2003-03-28  Eric Sandall <eric@sandall.us>

		Updated kdm.sh and gdm.sh to kill all instances
		of themselves (they didn't even work before)

		Added wdm.sh script.

2003-03-27  Eric Schabell <eschabell@sourcemage.org>

		Updated comments in script to give the user an
		example that is shown during the usage of the 
		runlvedit app.

2003-03-26  Eric Schabell <eschabell@sourcemage.org>

		Added runlvedit, a runlevel editor from RockLinux,
		ported by Vaclav Kulakovsky. More comments in the 
		editor are to follow to provide better info on how
		to use it from the interface. Try it, you will like
		it! 

2003-03-06  Eric Schabell <eschabell@sourcemage.org>

		Added rc, rcS and halt.sh to scriptdir, these
		were missing still from the collection.

2003-02-24  Eric Schabell <eschabell@sourcemage.org>

		Remomved -
					apache.sh (is in apache spells).
					cups (cups.sh is in cups spell).
					modutils.sh (in spell modutils).
					lib_runlevel (script in sorcery).
					xinetd.sh (in spell).

		Added to working scripts dir -
					atd.sh
					ksyslogd.sh
					crond.sh
					gdm.sh (add runlevels by hand)
					kdm.sh (add runlevels by hand)
					xdm.sh (add runlevels by hand)
					lm_sensors.s (add runlevels by hand)

		This is only usable with the devel sorcery for now. I will
		bump up to testing grimoire asap after next sorcery release.

2003-01-17  Eric Schabell <eschabell@sourcemage.org>

		Updated the savetime var in lib_runlevel so that the
		hour variable is %H instead of %k (padding with zeros now).
		Fixes bug #2258.

2003-01-14  Eric Schabell <eschabell@sourcemage.org>

		Removed "-n" from echo lines in mountnfs.sh, this was
		casuing problems in startup of machines. Also cleaned up
		this history format, what a mess eh!

2002-11-17  Neal Birch <nealbirch@attbi.com>

	    Added function to remove wayward mount.sh files. 
		Cleaned code a bit.
		
2002-11-16  Neal Birch <nealbirch@attbi.com>

	    Added --localtime to stop function in localtime.sh to fix 
		bug 1679. Modified configure to fix bug 1692.
		
2002-11-11  Neal Birch <nealbirch@attbi.com>

	    Added localtime.sh to spell.
		
2002-10-24  Neal Birch <nealbirch@attbi.com>

	    Moved networking.sh to net-tools and modified CONFIGURE to recognize 
		that. Modified mount.sh to not mount networked drives. Added mountnfs.sh 
		to scriptdir to provide for networked drives. Modified configure to 
		detect and allow for custom scripts. Added lib_runlevel functions for 
		runlevel management.
		
2002-10-20  Neal Birch <nealbirch@attbi.com>

	    Modified networking.sh to take into consideration those who have 
		GATEWAY set by another program, such as PPP for aDSL.

2002-10-16  Neal Birch <nealbirch@attbi.com>

	    Modified networking.sh and the CONFIGURE script to take in 
		consideration those who put their network device drivers into 
		the kernel, fixes bug 1308. Corrected usage info to reflect 
		ability to load a specific device or devices.

2002-10-10  Eric Schabell <eschabell@sourcemage.org>

		Removed -H from networking script, fixes bug#1196.

2002-10-02  Eric Sandall <eric@sandall.us>

		Modified mount.new.sh to not mount networked filesystems, as 
		networking hasn't been started at this stage in the boot process.
		
		Added mountnfs.sh which mounts the networked filesystems, since 
		networking should have been started by now.  :)  This and mount.new 
		should replace the current mount.sh, once they've been tested a 
		little more.  :)  I use them on all of my machines, and they got 
		rid of those "Failed" errors for mount and the "RPC not found" for 
		trying to mount my networked filesystems.
		
		Added and xdm.sh, gdm.sh and kdm.sh to start those login managers, 
		should create one for wdm as well (when is my wdm spell going to go in?).

2002-10-2   Neal Birch <nealbirch@attbi.com>

	    Fixed typo in libinit.d. Thanks nkj!
		
2002-9-30   Neal Birch <nealbirch@attbi.com>

	    Modified BUILD to take care of lack of check for existing script 
		file bug (Thanks, Treeve!); changed scripts directory name to 
		scriptdir to prevent possible naming conflicts, changed name of 
		script.que to scriptque.temp to ease removal of temp files.
		
2002-9-29   Neal Birch <nealbirch@attbi.com>

	    Added CONFIGURE and modified BUILD to match. Now uses dialog to 
		make life a little easier. 
		
2002-9-24   Neal Birch <nealbirch@attbi.com>

	    Modified networking.sh further. Added change to save scripts that uses 
		current date and time as extension for backup purposes. Cleaned up and 
		reordered the BUILD code a little.
		
2002-9-23   Neal Birch <nealbirch@attbi.com>

	    Modified Build to correct error due to quotes around a variable 
		causing build failure. Changed SGL-script-version to reflect date 
		script was modified (yearmonthday: 20020923) vs sequential numbering 
		system for ease of tracking updates per M.L.'s suggestion. 
		
2002-09-22  Neal Birch <nealbirch@attbi.com>

	    Modified BUILD to install new networking schema. 
		It should copy existing information from the current 
		networking.sh and setup the links for the runlevels properly.

2002-09-16  Eric Sandall <eric@sandall.us>

		Added Nealbirch's init.d scripts, but just so they're 
		here, ready to be used.  Nothing is done with them as of yet.  :)
		
		Removed functions.bz2 (I thought I did this already...)
		
		Modified BUILD to check for each symlink, at WaRL0CK's, Oadae's, 
		and toomanymirrors' suggestion.  Fixes the mounting problems everyone 
		has been having, though I still don't know where the problem came from.  
		Oadae suggested it happened from the transition for e2fsprogs->init.d 
		and the changes which kept happening, and this might be correct.  
		Anyways, symlinks will now be (re)created if they don't exist.

2002-09-12  Eric Sandall <eric@sandall.us>
		Uncompressed functions.bz2 and mount.sh.bz2
		Made BUILD simpler, for now

2002-09-09  Eric Sandall <eric@sandall.us>
		Added 'true' to POST_INSTALL and PRE_BUILD
		Moved mount.sh from e2fsprogs to init.d (Bug #914)
		Revised BUILD to track (via 'install') the files installed

2002-08-21  Eric Sandall <eric@sandall.us>
		This spell adds /etc/init.d/functions for general use init functions and variables
		Will go into a basesystem-type spell once we get that worked out
