		Changed the check for new init in PREPARE to match the one
		in PRE_BUILD.
		Added two checks to PREPARE:
		- check for current devel sorcery (i.e. check for libinitd)
		- check for current coreutils (i.e. check for /bin/false)
		If either of these checks fails, PREPARE exits with an exit
		code of 1 which makes sorcery abort the cast.
		These checks were added to make sure that the preparations for
		the transition to simpleinit are only made if the installed
		sorcery can actually handle it.

		Added some stuff from old bootmisc script to mountall.sh
		Added z-misc.sh to handle /etc/sysconfig/{bootmisc|haltmisc}
		Added some more telinit stuff ... not yet totally robust.

2003-08-14  Seth Woolley <seth@tautology.org>

2003-08-13  Seth Woolley <seth@tautology.org>

		Don't need textutils installed anymore, using bash builtins
		instead of wc for syslog logger
		Fix bug #3918, halt_action=power_off instead of default, halt.

2003-08-10  Robert Helgesson <rycee@home.se>

		Added ESSENTIAL_FAIL_ACTION-option to /etc/sysconfig/init. It
		determines what should happen when an essential script exits
		with an error code.
		Modified mountall.sh to only exit with error if mounting /
		fails.

2003-08-03  Seth Woolley <seth@tautology.org>

		Fixed telinit <random> causing reboot

		Don't mess with /etc/sysconfig/devices unless user is
		converting to devfs on /dev.

		Start devfsd in mountall.sh instead of separate devfsd script,
		avoids deadlock.
