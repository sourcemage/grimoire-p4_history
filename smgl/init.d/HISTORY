	(bug 3597)

2004-02-06 hgg <hgreig@bigpond.net.au>
	* BUILD: install_root fixes
	* PRE_BUILD: only if CROSS_INSTALL is off
	* rc: add "bash" before executing an initscript so it will still start even if bootdisabled (bug #5595)

2003-12-15 Robert Helgesson <rhelgesson@sourcemage.org>
	* files/smgl_function: Don't pass on the modified echo when running a
	program through loadproc.

2003-11-29 Arwed v. Merkatz <v.merkatz@gmx.net>
	* CONFIGURE, POST_INSTALL: add DEVFS_ON_DEV config variable so
	  /etc/sysconfig/devices is always changed to have the correct
	  DEVICES setting

2003-11-15 Eric Sandall <eric@sandall.us>
	* init.d/keymap.sh: loadkeys is in /bin not /usr/bin
	  Finally decided to get rid of that stupid error
	* DETAILS: Updated to 2.1.3

2003-11-06 Seth Woolley <seth@tautology.org>
	* files/smgl_functions: get last bits of wc -l out and replaced
	  with bash builtins.
	* DETAILS: Updated and incremented to 2.1.2.

2003-11-04 Seth Woolley <seth@tautology.org>
	* init.d/hostname.sh: fix to allow coreutils hostname to work.
	* DETAILS: Updated incremented to get this fix in so I don't see 
	  it creeping up in the chat room again, and version to 2.1.1.
	* HISTORY: new format, somewhat.

2003-10-08 Seth Woolley <seth@tautology.org>
	* files/smgl_functions: Fixed issue with exporting the 
	  echo override but not its child functions, removed 
	  init.d: prefix, made syslogging optional.
	* files/smgl_telinit: added telinit-specific rc stuff
	* files/rc: removed telinit-specific stuff for smgl_telinit
	* BUILD: added smgl_telinit on install
	* init.d/init.conf: edited for syslog option.

2003-09-20 Seth Woolley <seth@tautology.org>
	* Fixed syslog logger sometimes not there bug (I hope).
	* DEVICES=/dev now, by default (otherwise recasting sucks).
	* PARALLEL_INIT support (optional, default off).
	* See /etc/sysconfig/init:PARALLEL_INIT to enable.
	* Different script display now that supports PARALLEL_INIT.
	* Updated to version 2.1.
	* Really fixed my logger fix.
	* Make sure colors don't go to logger, only screen

2003-08-25 Eric Schabell <eschabell@sourcemage.org>
	* Applied /usr mounting fix to smgl_init for rycee.

2003-08-22 hgg <hgreig@bigpond.net.au>

2003-08-21 hgg <hgreig@bigpond.net.au>
	* CONFIGURE+POST_INSTALL: Fix Typo to correctly edit 
	  /etc/securetty

2003-08-19 Arwed v. Merkatz <v.merkatz@gmx.net>
	* PREPARE: Changed the check for new init to match the one
	  in PRE_BUILD.
	  Added two checks to PREPARE:
	  - check for current devel sorcery (i.e. check for libinitd)
	  - check for current coreutils (i.e. check for /bin/false)
	  If either of these checks fails, PREPARE exits with an exit
	  code of 1 which makes sorcery abort the cast.
	  These checks were added to make sure that the preparations for
	  the transition to simpleinit are only made if the installed
	  sorcery can actually handle it.

2003-08-17 Seth Woolley <seth@tautology.org>
	* init.d/mountall.sh: Added some stuff from old bootmisc script
	* init.d/z-misc.sh: Added z-misc.sh to handle
	  /etc/sysconfig/{bootmisc|haltmisc}
	* Added some more telinit stuff ... not yet totally robust.

2003-08-14 Seth Woolley <seth@tautology.org>
	* Fixed calls to pidof tripping over itself.

2003-08-13 Seth Woolley <seth@tautology.org>
	* Don't need textutils installed anymore, using bash builtins
	  instead of wc for syslog logger
	* Fix bug #3918, halt_action=power_off instead of default, halt.

2003-08-10 Robert Helgesson <rycee@home.se>
	* files/init.conf: Added ESSENTIAL_FAIL_ACTION-option.
	  It determines what should happen when an essential script exits
	  with an error code.
	* init.d/mountall.sh: Modified to only exit with error if mounting /
	  fails.

2003-08-03 Seth Woolley <seth@tautology.org>
	* Fixed telinit <random> causing reboot
	* Added syslog logging of init and some more telinit commands.

2003-08-01 Eric Sandall <eric@sandall.us>
	* Misspelling.  :)

2003-07-31 Robert Helgesson <rycee@home.se>
	* Don't mess with /etc/sysconfig/devices unless user is
	  converting to devfs on /dev.
	* Start devfsd in mountall.sh instead of separate devfsd script,
	  avoids deadlock.

2003-07-30 Robert Helgesson <rycee@home.se>
	* Cleaned up smgl_functions a bit.
	* Added required_executable and optional_executable functions in
	  smgl_functions.
