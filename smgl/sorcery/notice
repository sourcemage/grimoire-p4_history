 It is no longer possible to  use as a spell. This is to let you know 
 that this spell will be removed in the near future, all references to
 the following old sorcery spells will be removed from your system:

grimoire-only-devel
grimoire-only-test
grimoire-only-stable
sorcery-only
sorcery-devel
sorcery-test
sorcery-stable
sorcery-sound (part of old sorcery code)

 NOTE: A script which performs a sorcery restore has been copied to your
      /tmp directory, named 'sorcery-rescue.sh'. You can run this by 
	  hand if you so need.

 After all this, you will be able to update your sorcery scripts
 with 'sorcery update', and to update you're entire system, you must
 now use 'sorcery system-update'. See sorcery help for more info.
