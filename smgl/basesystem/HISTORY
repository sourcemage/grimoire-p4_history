		(Hopefully) fixed Bug #1500

2002-10-21  Eric Schabell <eschabell@sourcemage.org>

		Ajusted DEPENDS to show optional sound dep as
		an existing spell (simpsons). This would be better
		if the user could be asked to select one of the
		four possible spells (misc, ferris, startrek, simpsons).

2002-10-21  Eric Sandall <eric@sandall.us>

		Put in blank BUILD, PRE_BUILD, and POST_BUILD, as this is a meta spell
		Basesystem will no longer fail upon cast

2002-10-14  Eric Sandall <eric@sandall.us>

		Put basesystem into CVS
