Prometheus is the bringer of fire.

With prometheus one can repeatedly cast and dispel spells, all the way
through the grimoire, over and over again; relentlessly and mercilessly
to no end, making the system beg for mercy.

This is a brute-force way of testing our grimoire's for bugs, and thus
providing a more stable system. Eventually it will automatically make
bug reports in bugzilla and everything, for now it just casts and dispels.

From the chaos we will achieve stability.

to use this:
setup a chroot/uml/native system first
cast this in it
make a custom /etc/prometheus/pm-config file to overide /etc/pm-config
run pm-setup
run pm-test once

please read the docs/wiki/source or email me with questions/comments/bugs

NOTE: due to UI changes, prometheus currently only works with stable
sorcery 1.3, not with devel sorcery. If you want to hack up pm-autocast
to deal with the new requires menu it would be greatly appreciated.

NOTE: prometheus now handles provides by just choosing the first entry in the list 
This will change in the future but is a simple fix for now.
For now please contact Hamish Greig <games@sourcemage.org> with any queries, Andrew (the author) is busy finishing 
school.
