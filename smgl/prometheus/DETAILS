Prometheus is the bringer of fire.

With prometheus one can repeatedly cast and dispel spells, all the way
through the grimoire, over and over again; relentlessly and mercilously
to no end, making the system beg for mercy.

This is a brute-force way of testing our grimoire's for bugs, and thus
providing a more stable system. Eventually it will automatically make
bug reports in bugzilla and everything, for now it just casts and dispels.

From the chaos we will achieve stability.
