Trying out some adjustments to the spell, namely installing to another
location, removing the generation numbers since we're using the .gpg
files as keyrings, any key on the keyring works. Also adding my signing
keys to the keyring. I'll integrate when Im content with the way this
works and devel sorcery supports it (which may require more changes here).
