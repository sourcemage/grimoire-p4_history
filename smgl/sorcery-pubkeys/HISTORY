2005-01-18 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* DETAILS: increment version so everyone has to recast it and
	  pick up the changes below.
	* INSTALL: now that devel sorcery has a specific place for gpg
	  keys, look there by default

2005-01-18 Andrew Stitt <astitt@sourcemage.org>
	* added my public key for sorcery tarballs to the sorcery keys
	* abandon the generation number idea since we're going to have multiple
	  keys in a keyring
	* INSTALL: install to /usr/share/smgl-pubkeys instead of
	  /etc/sorcery/local

2004-12-23 Seth Woolley <seth@tautology.org>
	* added generation numbers to the public keys so we can overlap 
	  multiple generations (when we update public keys).

2004-12-22 Seth Woolley <seth@tautology.org>
	* added spell, and yes I know we don't distribute devel grimoire 
	  to the public.
