	* added my public key for sorcery tarballs to the sorcery keys
	* abandon the generation number idea since we're going to have multiple
	  keys in a keyring
	* INSTALL: install to /usr/share/smgl-pubkeys instead of
	  /etc/sorcery/local

	* added generation numbers to the public keys so we can overlap 
	  multiple generations (when we update public keys).

	* added spell, and yes I know we don't distribute devel grimoire 
	  to the public.
