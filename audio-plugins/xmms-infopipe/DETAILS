XMMS InfoPipe is a plugin that reports XMMS status via named pipe. Handy if you want to add interesting real-time information for a personal web page, or a web cam page.

While there's a possibility of setting up programs to be executed by XMMS when changing songs, XMMS InfoPipe provides better introspection: You can get information on song position, song length, playlist position, status (stopped/playing/paused), song title as displayed by XMMS, and file name. The information is reported in easily parseable textual format.

The possibilities for information use are limitless. So far, here are some of the things people have been using InfoPipe for:

    * Showing information of XMMS on home page, webcam page, or something related (script included)
    * Showing player information on IRC (spotted one script for Irssi)
    * Using any speech synthetizer to say the song information, reducing the need for external displays, and helping listening to unfamiliar music in bed when all you have is a remote control =) (script included).
      Yeah, LIRC plugin seems to support this already, but it only supports ViaVoice - this allows you to use any speech synth... or any other types of output. Just an example of flexibility - I created the script to do that at 4 o'clock in the morning, and even got 99% of Perl recommendations of good coding right, even when I wasn't fully awake =)
