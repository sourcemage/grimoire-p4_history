KOffice is an integrated office suite based on the KDE libraries.
KOffice currently includes KWord, KSpread, KPresenter, KChart,
Krayon, KIllustrator, KFormula, Kugar, and Kivio. There are no
special mail and news clients included in KOffice, because there are
KMail and KNode available for KDE anyway. All KOffice components work 
together, and you can embed every KOffice component into any other
KOffice component. This is realized using the KParts object model.
