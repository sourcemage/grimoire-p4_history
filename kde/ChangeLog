	most of the spells in the kde section have now been converted to BUILD_API=2
	this means that sorcery-1.10 is required
	most of the kde spells  now have a configure option to allow the user to choose 
	either the stable or development verion of kde. the default is the stable 
	version.
	Currently version 3.2.2  and 3.2.90 are provided
	3.2.2 has problems with gcc-3.4.0, whereas 3.2.90 builds correctly
