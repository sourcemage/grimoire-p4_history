cat << EOF
 TSE3 is a powerful open source sequencer engine written in C++. It is a 'sequencer engine' because it provides the actual driving force elements of a sequencer but provides no form of user interface. Sequencer applications or multimedia presentation packages will incorporate the TSE3 libraries to provide a user with MIDI sequencing facilities.

TSE3 is a mature library based on a lot of experience. Whilst not providing the user interface, it provides a lot of assistance to a UI, attempting to provide as much funcitonality as possible in as generic a manner as possible.
