  servers, multiple accounts, powerful filters, PGP/GnuPG privacy, inline
  attachments, and much more.

  instant messaging and group scheduling needs. 
* KOrganizer, the calendar and scheduling program for KDE, provides management
  of events and tasks, alarms and group scheduling.

  and emails.
