cat << EOF
Kdevmon is a utility for KDE that monitors the throughput of
a network device. It docks in Kicker (the KDE panel) and
shows the current network traffic as a diagram. There also is
a resizable main window that provides a larger traffic diagram
and displays the current net speed in bits per second.
Middle-clicking on the dock window or on the main window offers
you an overview of the amount of incoming/outgoing bits and the
current and the maximum bit rate.
