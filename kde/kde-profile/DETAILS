KDE is a powerful graphical desktop environment for Unix workstations.
It combines ease of use, contemporary functionality and outstanding
graphical design with the technological superiority of the Unix
operating system. KDE is a completely new desktop, incorporating a large
suite of applications for Unix workstations. While KDE includes a window
manager, file manager, panel, control center and many other components
that one would expect to be part of a contemporary desktop environment,
the true strength of this exceptional environment lies in the
interoperability of its components.
