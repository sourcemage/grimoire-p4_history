KMyMoney2 is specifically aimed at the typical home user at present.
Each account belongs to an institution and can be reconciled to balance your 
transactions.
QIF import and export is supported within accounts so KMyMoney2 can read files 
exported from other programs and when downloaded from online banking institutions.
A search dialog is also provided to let the user find transactions that match specific 
criteria.
Support for Categories and Payees are also provided allowing the user to input 
meaningful information, when entering transactions, and to provide a means for future 
incarnations of KMyMoney2 to provide reporting and budgeting features.
