KMyFirewall attempts to make it easier to setup IPTables based
firewalls on Linux systems.
It will be the right tool if you like to have a so called "Personal
Firewall" running on your Linux box, but don't have the time and/or
the interest to spend hours in front of the IPTables manual just to
setup a Firewall that keeps the "bad" people out. 


There is also the possibility to save entire rule sets, so you only
have to configure your rule set one time and then you can use it on
several computers giving each of them a similar configuration (p.e.
school networks, office, university etc.). For a complete list of the 
features have a look at the Features section

Programs can't do any magic so you still will have to know what your
firewall should do to setup your rule set. KMyFirewall just tries to
help you as much as possible, but you decide what it will do.
