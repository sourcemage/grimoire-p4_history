Qt is a toolkit for software developers. Qt simplifies the task of
writing and maintaining GUI (graphical user interface) applications. Qt
is written in C++ and is fully object-oriented. Qt is a multi-platform
toolkit. When you implement a program with Qt, you can run it on the X
Window System (Unix/X11) or Microsoft Windows NT/95/98/2000. Simply
compile the source code for the platform you want.
