           SHORT="Faster startups by fixing C++ object files"
cat << EOF
Program objprelink runs after the C++ compiler and before the C++ linker.
It transforms the .o files and tries to replace expensive relocations by cheaper ones.
This eventually requires less work from the dynamical loader and provides for faster startups in large C++ applications.
