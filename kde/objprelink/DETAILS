This is a Hack.
It does not work with binutils 2.12 - you need to downgrade to 2.11.x,
otherwise things will crash all the time !

Also. this will most likely be obsolete in the future, when we manage to
switch to Jakub Jelinek's prelinker or something similar.

Program objprelink runs after the C++ compiler and before the C++ linker.
It transforms the .o files and tries to replace expensive relocations by cheaper ones.
This eventually requires less work from the dynamical loader and provides for faster startups in large C++ applications.
