The kdeaccessibility package contains three KDE Accessibility Aids: KMouseTool, KMag and KMouth. 

*KMouseTool: KMouseTool is a Linux-based KDE program. It clicks the mouse for you, so you don't have to. KMouseTool works with any mouse or pointing device. 

*KMagnifier: KMagnifier (or kmag, its unix name) is a small utility for Linux to magnify a part of the screen. It magnifies the area of the screen around the mouse pointer or optionally a user defined area. Additionally it offers to save a magnified screenshot to disk.

*KMouth: KMouth is a KDE program which enables persons that cannot speak to let their computer speak, e.g. mutal people or people who have lost their voice. It has a text input field and speaks the sentences that you enter. It also has support for user defined phrasebooks.
