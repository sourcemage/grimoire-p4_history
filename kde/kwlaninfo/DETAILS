SHORT="KDE applet to monitor wlan interfaces"
cat << EOF
KWireless provides some information about wlan interfaces using /proc/net/wireless. 
It's a kicker panel applet and so you must start it with a right click on a empty 
space in the kicker panel and then add it.
"add->applet->kwireless".

At this, time it only works properly if the wlan interface is set to "managed" mode 
(Access point).
Further it's only tested with an Elsa Airlancer MC11 card.
