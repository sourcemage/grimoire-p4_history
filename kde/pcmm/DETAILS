cat << EOF
Portos Commander is a powerful and intuitive file manager patterned after
old-school managers like Midnight Commander and Norton Commander.  It features
basically all your file-management needs, quick document viewing according to
file type, browsing tar archives, integration of FTP, Samba, secure shell, and
other clients, file selection using wildcards or regular expressions, file
searching using various criteria, directory bookmarking, automatic file status
updating (via FAM), displaying the free space on the current partition, and
drag'n'drop.
