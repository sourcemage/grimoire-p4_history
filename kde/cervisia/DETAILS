Cervisia is a graphical KDE frontend for the CVS client.
It provides access to the following features:
* Updating or retrieving the status of a working directory or single files.
  Files are displayed in different colors depending on their status, and the
  shown files can be filtered according to their status. 
* Common operations like adding, removing and commiting files. 
* Advanced operations like adding and removing watches, editing and unediting
  files, locking and unlocking.
* Checking out and importing modules. 
* Graphical diff against the repository and between different revisions. 
* Blame-annotated view of a file. 
* View of the log messages in tree and list form. 
* Resolving of conflicts in a file. 
* Tagging and branching. 
* Updating to a tag, branch or date. 
* A Changelog editor coupled with the commit dialog. 

Please note that in order for this spell to work docbook-dtd _MUST_ be cast
before kdebase!
