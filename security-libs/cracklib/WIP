Fails to install. No Makefile exists until after ./configure is run, and then it complains (if the sedits in PRE_BUILD are removed):
...
make[1]: Leaving directory `/usr/src/cracklib-2.8.3'
cp: cannot stat `cracklib-words': No such file or directory

Got it to complete the install but not quite sure it works big difference in
terms of the install log from 2.7... would like some tests before this goes
to test
