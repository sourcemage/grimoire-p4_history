lshwd - lists hardware devices and their approp modules. currently supports pci
,usb, pcmcia, and firewire devices. lshwd uses pcitable & usbtable files (can
be located at same directory or /usr/share/hwdata) for displaying extended
description and module names. module names are then parsed for generic names
and changes accordingly.
lshwd is a simple device lister with some very handy options. ideally, its
functionality should be similiar to kudzu/hwsetup but without the lag. when used
with '-a' it should auto-load approp modules. lshwd is intended for anyone who
wants to quickly check for his hardware specific modules without too much
hastle, for quick live-cds auto-detection and configure, 1st time linux n00bs,
etc. lshwd tries to mimic the lsxxx tools family (lspci,lsusb) output when no
commandline is specified. using '-cc' option provides a more "user-friendly"
output.
