ACPID is a completely flexible, totally extensible daemon for delivering ACPI events. It listens on a 
file (/proc/acpi/event) and when an event occurs, executes programs to handle the event. The programs it 
executes are configured through a set of configuration files, which can be dropped into place by packages 
or by the admin.
