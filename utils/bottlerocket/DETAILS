BottleRocket is an interface to the X10 FireCracker home automation
kit.  The FireCracker kit consists of a dongle-like RF transmitter
that connects to the serial port of a PC, and a receiver that plugs
into a wall socket and intercepts the signals, passing them on
through house wiring to other units that turn appliances on/off or
dim/brighten lamps.  It doesn't support any kind of 2-way
communication, unlike some of the other X10 products.
