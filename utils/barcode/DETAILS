GNU-barcode is meant to solve most needs in barcode
creation with a conventional printer. It can create
printouts for the conventional product-tagging
standards: UPC-A, UPC-E, EAN-13, EAN-8, ISBN, and
several others. Output is generated as either Postscript,
Encapsulated Postscript, or PCL (other back-ends may be
added if needed). The package is released as both a library
and a command-line frontend, so that you can include
barcode-generation into your application..
