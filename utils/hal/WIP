This needs testing to see if it breaks anything else

Comments by Flavien :
Yes it breaks gnome-volume-manager currently, but it will not break the next 
version in gnome 2.12. and is even required.

Please take care to do a p4 resolve, because I updated hal to 0.4.8 directly 
in test since devel was already at 0.5
