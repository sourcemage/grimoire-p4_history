cat << EOF
Powertweak-Linux is a tool to tune your system to its optimal
performance settings.  It started life as the replacement for the now
obsolete kernel option 'tune PCI bridges', and has been extended to
provide more features and support more chipsets.  It can also tune
network/filesystem performance using /proc/sys entries, disk elevator 
settings, and x86 CPU registers (needs 2.2.18 or 2.4.0test kernel),
CDROM speeds, hdparm type features, and Sony VAIO backlight. It has
both GTK and ncurses GUIs.
