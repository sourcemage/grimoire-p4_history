cat << EOF
syslog-ng, as the name shows, is a syslogd replacement, but with new
functionality for the new generation. The original syslogd allows
messages only to be sorted based on priority/facility pairs;
syslog-ng adds the possibility to filter based on message contents
using regular expressions. The new configuration scheme is intuitive
and powerful. Forwarding logs over TCP and remembering all forwarding 
hops makes it ideal for firewalled environments.
