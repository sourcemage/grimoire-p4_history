lmctl can configure vendor-specific options on Logitech USB mice (or
dual-personality mice plugged into the USB port). A number of recent devices
are supported. The program is mostly useful in setting the resolution to
800 cpi on mice that boot at 400 cpi (such as the author's MX-500), and
disabling SmartScroll or Cruise Control for those who would rather use the
two extra buttons as ordinary mouse buttons.

Hint 1: use a Linux kernel with Event Interface support (the evdev module)
if you want full access to the numerous buttons on these mice.

Hint 2: on Linux, the usbmouse driver ignores the extra buttons
altogether. Don't let it handle your Logitech mice - use the generic hid
driver for USB HID devices instead.
