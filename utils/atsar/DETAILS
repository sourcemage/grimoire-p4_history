cat << EOF
The atsar command can be used to detect performance bottlenecks on 
Linux systems. It is similar to the sar command on other UNIX 
platforms. Atsar has the ability to show what is happening on the 
system at a given moment (by supplying an interval as command-line 
argument). However, it also keeps track of the past system load by 
maintaining history files from which information can be extracted. 
Statistics about the utilization of CPUs, disks and disk partitions, 
memory and swap, tty's, TCP/IP (v4/v6), NFS, and FTP/HTTP traffic are 
gathered.
