CMatrix is a program I wrote one evening because I didn't want to have to run Wind*ws to see the cool scrolling lines from 'The Matrix', my fave movie.  If you haven't seen this movie and you are a fan of computers or sci-fi in general, go see this movie!!!  I have seen it twice, and I'm pondering seeing it again before it comes out on VHS.
