most is a paging program that displays, one windowful
at a time, the contents of a file on a terminal. It
pauses after each windowful and prints on the window
status line the screen the file name, current line
number, and the percentage of the file so far
displayed. Unlike other paging programs, most is
capable of displaying an arbitrary number of windows
as long as each window occupies at least two screen
lines.
