zengarden is a tool that watches over the installation and building of
source archives.  It is a fork of installwatch that has been heavily updated
with modern features.  It can prevent build tools from interfering with
files outside the build directory and create a virtual chroot to perform
installations in or backup the files the install overwrites.
