boxes is a text filter which can draw ASCII art boxes around its input text. These boxes may also be 
removed, even if they have been badly damaged by editing of the text inside. Since boxes may be open 
on any side, boxes can also be used to create regional comments in any programming language. With the 
help of an editor macro or mapping, damaged boxes can easily be repaired.
