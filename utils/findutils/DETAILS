findutils - Finds and then operates on files
The program includes:
bigram    -  used together with code to produce older-style locate databases
code      -  the ancestor of frcode. It was used in older-style locate databases
find      -  finds files that match certain criteria performs 
             arbitrary operations on them interactively and
             in shell scripts
frcode    -  called by updatedb to compress the list of file names using
             front-compression, which reduces the database size by a factor
             of 4 to 5
locate    -  scans a database for file names that match a pattern 
updatedb  -  update a file name database
xargs     -  applies a command to a list of files
