Metalog is a modern replacement for syslogd and klogd. The logged
messages can be dispatched according to their facility, urgency, program
name, and/or Perl-compatible regular expressions. Log files can be
automatically rotated when they exceed a certain size or age. External
shell scripts (e.g., mail) can be launched when specific patterns are
found. Metalog is easier to configure than syslogd and syslog-ng,
accepts an unlimited number of rules, and has (switchable) memory
bufferization for maximal performance.
