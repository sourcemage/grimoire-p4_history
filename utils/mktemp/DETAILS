What/why is mktemp?
===================
Mktemp is a simple utility designed to make temporary file handling
in shells scripts be safe and simple.  Traditionally, people writing
shell scripts have used constructs like:

    TFILE=/tmp/foop.$$

which are trivial to attack.  If such a script is run as root it may
be possible for an attacker on the local host to gain access to the
root login, corrupt or unlink system files, or do a variety of other
nasty things.

The basic problem is that most shells have no equivalent to open(2)'s
O_EXCL flag.  While it is possible to avoid this using temporary
directories, I consider the use of mktemp(1) to be superior both in terms
of simplicity and robustness.  See the man page for more information.
