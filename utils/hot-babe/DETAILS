Hot-babe is a small graphical utility which display the system activity
in a very special way. When the CPU is idle, it displays a dressed girl,
and when the activity goes up, as the temperature increases, the girl
begins to undress, to finish totally naked when the system activity
reaches 100%. Of course, if you can be shocked by nudity, don't use it!
