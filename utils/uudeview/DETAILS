UUDeview is a program that helps you transmit and receive binary files over the Internet,
using electronic mail or newsgroups The UUDeview package includes both an encoder and
a decoder. The decoder automatically detects the type of encoding used, offering MIME's
Base64 and BinHex as well as the popular uuencoding and the less frequently used
xxencoding methods. Recently, support for the popular yEnc encoding was also added. The
encoder runs the other way around and encodes a binary file for sending it by mail or news.

To clear up the most common misunderstandings right away, you do not need UUDeview when
downloading files from the World Wide Web, but only when using E-Mail and/or Usenet
newsgroups. UUDeview does not offer file compression or encryption.
