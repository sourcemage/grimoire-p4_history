cat << EOF

Daemon turns other process into daemons.  There are many tasks that need to be
performed to correctly set up a daemon process.  This can be tedious.  Daemon
performs these tasks for other processes.  This is useful for writing daemons
in languages other than C, C++ or Perl (e.g. /bin/sh, Java).

If you want to write daemons in languages that can link against C functions
(e.g. C, C++), see libslack which contains the core functionality of daemon.
