ColorDiff is a wrapper for diff and produces the same output as diff but with 
coloured syntax highlighting at the command line to improve readability. The 
output is similar to how a diff-generated patch might appear in Vim or Emacs 
with the appropriate syntax highlighting options enabled. The colour schemes 
can be read from a central configuration file or from a local user 
~/.colordiffrc file.
