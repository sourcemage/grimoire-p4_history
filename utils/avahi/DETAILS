Avahi is a system which facilitates service discovery on a local 
network. This means that you can plug your laptop or computer into a 
network and instantly be able to view other people who you can chat 
with, find printers to print to or find files being shared. This kind of 
technology is already found in MacOS X (branded 'Rendezvous', 'Bonjour' 
and sometimes 'Zeroconf') and is very convenient. Avahi is mainly based 
on Lennart Poettering's flexmdns mDNS implemenation for Linux which has 
been discontinued in favour of Avahi.
