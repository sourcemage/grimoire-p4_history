LTT provides its user with all the information required to reconstruct a system's behavior during a certain period of time. One can know exactly the dynamics of a system. Why do certain synchronization problems occur? What exactly happens to an application when a packet is received for it? Overall, where do all the applications that I use spend their time? Where are the I/O latencies in a given application? etc.
