sysklogd
The sysklogd package implements two system log daemons. The syslogd
daemon is the general system logging daemon which is responsible for
handling requests for syslog services. This version of syslogd is
similar to the standard Berkeley product but with a number of compatible
extensions. The klogd daemon runs either standalone or as a client of
syslogd. Klogd 'listens' to kernel log messages, prioritizes them, and
routes them to either output files or to syslogd. This version of klogd
will optionally translate kernel addresses to their symbolic equivalents
if provided with a system map.
