cat << EOF
Remind allows you to remind yourself of upcoming events and appointments
via a reasonably easy to understand config file.  Each reminder or alarm
can consist of a message sent to standard output, or a program to be
executed.

It also features: sophisticated date calculation, moon phases,
sunrise/sunset, Hebrew calendar, alarms, PostScript output, tcl/tk
front-end, multilingual messages, and proper handling of
holidays.

Includes scripts for making a nice WWW calendar server and provides
a graphical front-end for people who don't want to learn the scripting
language.
