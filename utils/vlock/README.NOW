spell should be able to be built without pam by removing some flags like the 
comment in the Makefile says only i haven't gotten it to work so i have added
Linux-PAM in the DEPENDS file. it should go something like this to compile 
without PAM support:

cat Makefile | \
sed -e 's/CFLAGS = $(RPM_OPT_FLAGS) -DUSE_PAM/CFLAGS = $(RPM_OPT_FLAGS)/' |    \
sed -e 's/LDFLAGS = -ldl -lpam -lpam_misc/LDFLAGS = -lpam_misc/'>Makefile.new; \
rm -f Makefile; mv Makefile.new Makefile
