SHORT="a library for reading and editing audio meta data"
cat << EOF
TagLib, is well, a library for reading and editing audio meta data, commonly know as 
tags.

 Some goals of TagLib:

 
A clean, high level, C++ API to handling audio meta data.
Support for at least ID3v1, ID3v2 and Ogg Vorbis comments.
A generic, simple API for the most common tagging related functions.
Binary compatibility between minor releases using the standard KDE/Qt techniques for 
C++ binary compatibility.
Make the tagging framework extensible by library users; i.e. it will be possible for 
libarary users to implement additional ID3v2 frames, without modifying the TagLib 
source (through the use of Abstract Factories and such.
