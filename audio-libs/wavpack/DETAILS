WavPack is a completely open audio compression format 
providing lossless, high-quality lossy, and a unique 
hybrid compression mode. In the default lossless mode 
WavPack acts just like a WinZip compressor for audio 
files. However, unlike MP3 or WMA encoding which can 
affect the sound quality, not a single bit of the 
original information is lost and so there's no chance 
of degradation. This makes lossless mode ideal for 
archiving audio material or any other situation where 
quality is paramount. The compression ratio depends on 
the source material, but generally is between 30% and 70%.  
The hybrid mode provides all the advantages of lossless 
compression with an additional bonus. Instead of creating 
a single file, this mode creates both a relatively small, 
high-quality lossy file that can be used all by itself, 
and a "correction" file that (when combined with the 
lossy file) provides full lossless restoration.
