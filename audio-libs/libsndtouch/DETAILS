cat << EOF
SoundTouch is an open-source audio processing library for changing the 
Tempo, Pitch and Playback Rates of audio streams or files:
    * Tempo (time-stretch): Changes the sound to play at faster or 
slower speed than original, without affecting the sound pitch.
    * Pitch (key) : Changes the sound pitch or key, without affecting 
the sound tempo or speed.
    * Playback Rate : Changes both the sound tempo and pitch, as if an 
LP disc was played at wrong RPM rate.
