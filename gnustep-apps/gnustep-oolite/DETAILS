Oolite is a space sim game, written for Mac OS X in Objective C using Cocoa and 
OpenGL.

It was written as my response to the withdrawal of Elite - The New Kind from 
the internet. Although inspired by the work of Christian Pinder, following 
David Braben and Ian Bell, the work is an independent interpretation and 
expansion of the original game.

Oolite is designed as a small game that is easy for users to pick up and expand
upon. Almost every aspect of the game can be modified using simple, free 
graphics packages and text-editors.
