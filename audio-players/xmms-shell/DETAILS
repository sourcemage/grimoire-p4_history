XMMS-Shell is a simple command-line utility for controlling XMMS. It
provides every command-line feature the xmms command provides, plus a few
others:
      * Volume control
      * Equalizer control
      * Control over display of main, equalizer, and playlist windows
      * Can pop up the preferences or file load dialogs
      * A few miscellaneous but potentially useful commands, such as FADE,
        FAKEPAUSE, and RESETDEVICE
