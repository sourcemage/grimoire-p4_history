Pitch the sound with same high sound quality as on your good old 
Technics 1210.
Beat track and automatic tempo sync makes beat mixing a breeeze
Waveform displays makes visual sync possible, and FishEye view mode 
gives you a tight startup.
Use mouse, keyboard, MIDI equipment, PowerMates, and joystics to 
interact with Mixxx. Low latency operation and hardware controllers 
makes the big difference in a live gig. Mixxx supports it all.
