cat << EOF
This is PyXMMS, a Python interface to XMMS (the X MultiMedia System), an audio
and video player for Unix-like platforms.

As of version 2.00, PyXMMS consists of two components:
    - a set of Python bindings for all the xmms_remote_* functions accessible
      through the libxmms library (which comes with XMMS), plus a few
      higher-level functions that I (Florent Rougon) find useful;
    - a Python wrapper around the functions for configuration file management
      in libxmms.

In short, the first component allows you to control XMMS from a Python program
while the second component is for Python programs that need to manage the XMMS
main configuration file (reading or writing).

These two components are accessible by means of the xmms.control and
xmms.config modules respectively.
