	SHORT="QSynth is a fluidsynth GUI front-end application"
cat << EOF
QSynth is a fluidsynth GUI front-end application written in C++ 
around the Qt3 toolkit using Qt Designer. Eventually it may evolve 
into a softsynth management application allowing the user to control 
and manage a variety of command line softsynth but for the moment it 
wraps the excellent Fluidsynth. Fluidsynth is a command line software 
synthesiser based on the Soundfont specification.
