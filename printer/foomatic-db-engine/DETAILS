Foomatic is a database-driven system for integrating free software printer
drivers with common spoolers under Unix.  It supports CUPS, LPRng, LPD, GNUlpr,
PPR, PDQ, CPS, and direct spooler-less printing with every free software
printer driver known to us and every printer known to work with these drivers.

This part contains Foomatic's database engine which generates PPD files from
the data in Foomatic's XML database.  It also contains scripts to directly
generate print queues and handle jobs.

For updated PPDs, go to the folloinwg URL:
