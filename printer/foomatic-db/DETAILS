Foomatic is a database-driven system for integrating free software printer
drivers with common spoolers under Unix.  It supports CUPS, LPRng, LPD, GNUlpr,
PPR, PDQ, CPS, and direct spooler-less printing with every free software
printer driver known to us and every printer known to work with these drivers.

This part contains the collected knowledge about printers, drivers, and driver
options in XML files, used by foomatic-db-engine to generate PPD files.

For updated PPDs, go to the folloinwg URL:
