ESP Ghostscript is a customized version of GNU Ghostscript that includes an
enhanced autoconf-based configuration script,  the CUPS raster driver to
support CUPS raster printer drivers, and additional patches and drivers from
various Linux distributors.

Ghostscript is the name of a set of software that provides:
    * An interpreter for the PostScript language and the PDF file format,
    * A set of C procedures (the Ghostscript library) that implement the
      graphics capabilities that appear as primitive operations in the
      PostScript language, and
    * A wide variety of output drivers for various file formats and printers.
