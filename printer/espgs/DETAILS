ESP Ghostscript is a customized version of GNU Ghostscript that includes an
enhanced autoconf-based configuration script,  the CUPS raster driver to
support CUPS raster printer drivers, and additional patches and drivers from
various Linux distributors.

Ghostscript is the name of a set of software that provides:
    * An interpreter for the PostScript language and the PDF file format,
    * A set of C procedures (the Ghostscript library) that implement the
      graphics capabilities that appear as primitive operations in the
      PostScript language, and
    * A wide variety of output drivers for various file formats and printers.

NOTE  the three spells cups, espgs and gimp-print represent a circular
  dependency relationship.  If you want all three spells installed, cast
  espgs first, answering n to gimp-print.  Then cast cups.  Then cast espgs
  again with the -r -c options and answer y to gimp-print and y to
  gimp-prints optional_depends of cups.  Like so,

  cast espgs        # No to gimp-print
  cast cups
  cast -r -c espgs  # Yes to gimp-print and yes to cups
