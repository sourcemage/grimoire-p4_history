Magicfilter is an extensible and customizable automatic printer filter.  It
selects an appropriate conversion technique for the input data by seeking for
magic numbers, and then utilizing the appropriate conversion utility.

Magicfilter is primarily intended for use as the input filter by the lpd
print spooler.  The options accepted by magicfilter are exactly the ones
passed to the input filter by lpd.

Magicfilter 2 is a complete rewrite of H. Peter Anvin's Magicfilter 1.2, using
slightly more standard components.  It has the following features:

  *  It uses file magic to determine what sort of data it's been fed.
  *  Filters are a compact set of m4 defines that are merged with a common
     filter ruleset that is then used to process the input data.
  *  system() is no longer used to execute filters and pipes; they are now
     directly execvp'ed to cut down on the number of processes magicfilter
     launches.
  *  All new processes are children of magicfilter, instead of some being
     punted off into their own little groups.
  *  All the new code is released under a BSD-style copyright.
