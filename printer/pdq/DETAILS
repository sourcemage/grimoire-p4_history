cat << EOF

pdq is a direct replacement of lpr.  Adding and configuring printers does not
require root privilege.  Jobs can be monitored through completion, job status
can be checked *after* completion.  Users can create custom command line
options to set features such as tray selection, color mode, and print quality
options.  xpdq provides a graphical GTK based interface to simplify printer
and option selection, and provides a wizard for printer installation.
