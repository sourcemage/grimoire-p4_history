CUPS is a wonderful printing system that uses the emerging IPP protocol.  The
only drawback is that there is quite no free driver available to print with.
CUPS-drivers address this issue by providing a generic printer driver using
GNU GhostScript.  Not many printers are supported to date, but all is in
place to support as many printers as GS can.  If GS supports your printer,
then CUPS-drivers will support it as well.  Help and feedback are welcomed.
