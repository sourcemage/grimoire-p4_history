CUPS is a wonderful printing system that uses the emerging IPP protocol.
The only drawback is that there is quite no free driver available to
print with. CUPS-drivers address this issue by providing a generic
printer driver using GNU GhostScript. Not many printers are supported to
date, but all is in place to support as many printers as GS can. If GS
supports your printer, then CUPS-drivers will support it as well. Help
and feedback are welcomed.
