The following components comprise the Enhanced Printing System:

    End-user tools:

    * printtool - An upgrade to Red Hat's printtool which "Auto Detects"
      printers using libprinterconf, creates printcap entries with
      printfilters and then creates print queues.
    * gpr - An end-user print GUI front-end for lpr which enables selection
      of print queues and printer settings. Printer-specific sections of the
      GUI are dynamically constructed based on the PPD file for the printer
      (using libppd).
    * lpr - An upgrade to lpr which accepts new command line options for job
      attributes described by PPD files and passes them to printfilters
      scripts. This package is not installed on LPRng systems.

    Back-end tools/libraries:

    * libprinterconf - A library of functions helpful for detecting printers
      connected on parallel ports and networks.
    * libprinterconf-devel - Header files and documentation.
    * printfilters - A replacement for rhs-printfilters, a collection of
      scripts and databases, that maps spooler filters to PPD files and uses
      ppdfilt to modify PostScript print jobs.
    * libppd - A library supporting reading PostScript PPD files.
    * libppd-devel - Header files and documentation for libppd.
    * ppdfilt - A stand-alone utility that modifies PostScript files based on
      command line options and a PPD file.
    * snmpkit - A library of helpful functions for using SNMP to communicate
      (used by libprinterconf).
    * snmpkit-devel - Header files and documentation.
