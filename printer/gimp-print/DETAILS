Gimp-Print is a collection of very high quality printer drivers for
UNIX/Linux. The goal of this project is uncompromising print quality and
robustness. Included with this package is the Print plugin for the GIMP
(hence the name), a CUPS driver, and a driver for Ghostscript that may be
compiled into that package. This driver package is Foomatic-compatible to
enable plug and play with many print spoolers. In addition, various printer
maintenance utilities are included. Many users report that the quality of
Gimp-Print on high end Epson Stylus printers matches or exceeds the quality
of the drivers supplied for Windows and Macintosh.
