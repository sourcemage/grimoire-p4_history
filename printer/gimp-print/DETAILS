Gimp-Print is a collection of very high quality printer drivers for
UNIX/Linux. The goal of this project is uncompromising print quality and
robustness. Included with this package is the Print plugin for the GIMP
(hence the name), a CUPS driver, and a driver for Ghostscript that may
be compiled into that package. This driver package is
Foomatic-compatible to enable plug and play with many print spoolers. In
addition, various printer maintenance utilities are included. Many users
report that the quality of Gimp-Print on high end Epson Stylus printers
matches or exceeds the quality of the drivers supplied for Windows and
Macintosh.
