The Hewlett-Packard Linux Imaging and Printing project (HPLIP) provides a
unified single and multi-function connectivity solution for Linux. The goal of
this project is to provide "radically simple" printing, faxing, scanning,
photo-card access, and device management to the consumer and small business
desktop Linux users. This project is based open source software and uses GPL
compatible licenses.

See http://hpinkjet.sourceforge.net for instructions on how to configure your
