cat << EOF

The Common UNIX Printing System (CUPS) provides a portable printing layer for
UNIX(r)-based operating systems.  It has been developed to promote a standard
printing solution for all UNIX vendors and users.  CUPS provides the System V
and Berkeley commandline interfaces, uses the Internet Printing Protocol
("IPP") as the basis for managing print jobs and queues, supports (with
reduced functionality) the Line Printer Daemon ("LPD"), Server Message Block
("SMB"), and AppSocket (a.k.a. JetDirect) protocols, and adds network printer
browsing and PostScript Printer Description ("PPD")-based printing options to
support real-world printing under UNIX.  CUPS also includes a customized
version of GNU Ghostscript and an image file RIP that are used to support
non-PostScript printers. Sample drivers for HP and EPSON printers are
included that use these filters.
