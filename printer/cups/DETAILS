cat << EOF

The Common UNIX Printing System (CUPS) provides a portable printing layer for
UNIX(r)-based operating systems.  It has been developed to promote a standard
printing solution for all UNIX vendors and users.  CUPS provides the System V
and Berkeley commandline interfaces, uses the Internet Printing Protocol
(IPP) as the basis for managing print jobs and queues, supports (with
reduced functionality) the Line Printer Daemon (LPD), Server Message Block
(SMB), and AppSocket (a.k.a. JetDirect) protocols, and adds network printer
browsing and PostScript Printer Description (PPD)-based printing options to
support real-world printing under UNIX.  CUPS also includes a customized
version of GNU Ghostscript and an image file RIP that are used to support
non-PostScript printers. Sample drivers for HP and EPSON printers are
included that use these filters.

NOTE  the three spells cups, espgs and gimp-print represent a circular
  dependency relationship.  If you want all three spells installed, cast
  espgs first, answering n to gimp-print.  Then cast cups.  Then cast espgs
  again with the -r -c options and answer y to gimp-print and y to
  gimp-prints optional_depends of cups.  Like so,

  cast espgs        # No to gimp-print
  cast cups
  cast -r -c espgs  # Yes to gimp-print and yes to cups
