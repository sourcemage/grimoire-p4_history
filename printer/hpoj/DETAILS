This is an HP-sponsored project to develop Linux
support for most Hewlett-Packard OfficeJet, PSC,
LaserJet, and PhotoSmart printer all-in-one
peripherals (also known as Multi-Function
Peripherals or MFPs), which depending on the
model can print, scan, copy, fax, and/or access
digital camera memory cards.

It is a work in progress, but printing and scanning
are supported on most models, when either connected
to the parallel port or USB on a Linux (Intel or Alpha)
workstation, or to a LAN with selected HP JetDirect
print servers.
